<h2>Real-Time Safe Bipedal Robot Navigation using Linear Discrete Control Barrier Functions</h2>
<h3>Chengyang Peng, Victor Paredes, Guillermo A. Castillo, Ayonga Hereid</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe navigation in real-time is an essential task for humanoid robots in real-world deployment. Since humanoid robots are inherently underactuated thanks to unilateral ground contacts, a path is considered safe if it is obstacle-free and respects the robot's physical limitations and underlying dynamics. Existing approaches often decouple path planning from gait control due to the significant computational challenge caused by the full-order robot dynamics. In this work, we develop a unified, safe path and gait planning framework that can be evaluated online in real-time, allowing the robot to navigate clustered environments while sustaining stable locomotion. Our approach uses the popular Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model as a template model to represent walking dynamics. It incorporates heading angles in the model to evaluate kinematic constraints essential for physically feasible gaits properly. In addition, we leverage discrete control barrier functions (DCBF) for obstacle avoidance, ensuring that the subsequent foot placement provides a safe navigation path within clustered environments. To guarantee real-time computation, we use a novel approximation of the DCBF to produce linear DCBF (LDCBF) constraints. We validate the proposed approach in simulation using a Digit robot in randomly generated environments. The results demonstrate that our approach can generate safe gaits for a non-trivial humanoid robot to navigate environments with randomly generated obstacles in real-time.</p>

<h2>Heteroscedastic Temporal Variational Autoencoder For Irregular Time Series</h2>
<h3>Satya Narayan Shukla, Benjamin M. Marlin</h3>
<p>arXiv:2107.11350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Irregularly sampled time series commonly occur in several domains where they present a significant challenge to standard deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework for probabilistic interpolation of irregularly sampled time series that we call the Heteroscedastic Temporal Variational Autoencoder (HeTVAE). HeTVAE includes a novel input layer to encode information about input observation sparsity, a temporal VAE architecture to propagate uncertainty due to input sparsity, and a heteroscedastic output layer to enable variable uncertainty in output interpolations. Our results show that the proposed architecture is better able to reflect variable uncertainty through time due to sparse and irregular sampling than a range of baseline and traditional models, as well as recently proposed deep latent variable models that use homoscedastic output layers.</p>

<h2>Statistical analysis to assess porosity equivalence with uncertainty across additively manufactured parts for fatigue applications</h2>
<h3>Justin P. Miner, Sneha Prabha Narra</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.03401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work on fatigue prediction in Powder Bed Fusion - Laser Beam has shown that the estimate of the largest pore size within the stressed volume is correlated with the resulting fatigue behavior in porosity-driven failures. However, single value estimates for the largest pore size are insufficient to capture the experimentally observed scatter in fatigue properties. To address this gap, in this work, we incorporate uncertainty quantification into extreme value statistics to estimate the largest pore size distribution in a given volume of material by capturing uncertainty in the number of pores present and the upper tail parameters. We then applied this statistical framework to compare the porosity equivalence between two geometries: a 4-point bend fatigue specimen and an axial fatigue specimen in the gauge section. Both geometries were manufactured with the same process conditions using Ti-6Al-4V, followed by porosity characterization via X-ray Micro CT. The results show that the largest pore size distribution of the 4-point bend specimen is insufficient to accurately capture the largest pore size observed in the axial fatigue specimen, despite similar dimensions. Based on our findings, we provide insight into the design of witness coupons that exhibit part-to-coupon porosity equivalence for fatigue.</p>
