<h2>Online optimisation for dynamic electrical impedance tomography</h2>
<h3>Neil Dizon, Jyrki Jauhiainen, Tuomo Valkonen</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.12944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online optimisation studies the convergence of optimisation methods as the data embedded in the problem changes. Based on this idea, we propose a primal dual online method for nonlinear time-discrete inverse problems. We analyse the method through regret theory and demonstrate its performance in real-time monitoring of moving bodies in a fluid with Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). To do so, we also prove the second-order differentiability of the Complete Electrode Model (CEM) solution operator on $L^\infty$.</p>

<p>arXiv:2503.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are necessary for measuring and predicting occurrences and habitat suitability of species and their relationship with environmental factors. We introduce a novel presence-only SDM with graph neural networks (GNN). In our model, species and locations are treated as two distinct node sets, and the learning task is predicting detection records as the edges that connect locations to species. Using GNN for SDM allows us to model fine-grained interactions between species and the environment. We evaluate the potential of this methodology on the six-region dataset compiled by National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) for benchmarking SDMs. For each of the regions, the heterogeneous GNN model is comparable to or outperforms previously-benchmarked single-species SDMs as well as a feed-forward neural network baseline model.</p>

<h2>Power Swing Trajectory Influenced by Virtual Impedance-Based Current-Limiting Strategy</h2>
<h3>Yanshu Niu, Zhe Yang, Bikash C. Pal</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.12278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) can emulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through appropriate control loop design. However, in systems with GFM IBRs, the apparent impedance trajectory under current limitation differs significantly from that of SG-based systems due to the limited overcurrent capability of power electronic devices. This difference challenges the power swing detection functions of distance relays designed for SG-based systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the apparent impedance trajectory over a full power swing cycle under two typical current-limiting strategies: variable virtual impedance (VI) and adaptive VI. The analysis reveals that the trajectory under VI current-limiting strategies differs significantly from that of a conventional SG. The results also indicate that the control parameters affect the characteristics of the trajectory. In addition, the new trajectories challenge conventional power swing detection functions, increasing the risk of malfunction. Furthermore, the implementation of VI leads to a deterioration in system stability. The theoretical analysis is further validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.</p>

<h2>EmoBipedNav: Emotion-aware Social Navigation for Bipedal Robots with Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<h3>Wei Zhu, Abirath Raju, Abdulaziz Shamsah, Anqi Wu, Seth Hutchinson, Ye Zhao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.12538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an emotion-aware navigation framework -- EmoBipedNav -- using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for bipedal robots walking in socially interactive environments. The inherent locomotion constraints of bipedal robots challenge their safe maneuvering capabilities in dynamic environments. When combined with the intricacies of social environments, including pedestrian interactions and social cues, such as emotions, these challenges become even more pronounced. To address these coupled problems, we propose a two-stage pipeline that considers both bipedal locomotion constraints and complex social environments. Specifically, social navigation scenarios are represented using sequential LiDAR grid maps (LGMs), from which we extract latent features, including collision regions, emotion-related discomfort zones, social interactions, and the spatio-temporal dynamics of evolving environments. The extracted features are directly mapped to the actions of reduced-order models (ROMs) through a DRL architecture. Furthermore, the proposed framework incorporates full-order dynamics and locomotion constraints during training, effectively accounting for tracking errors and restrictions of the locomotion controller while planning the trajectory with ROMs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach exceeds both model-based planners and DRL-based baselines.

<h2>Robot Skin with Touch and Bend Sensing using Electrical Impedance Tomography</h2>
<h3>Haofeng Chen, Bin Li, Bedrich Himmel, Xiaojie Wang, Matej Hoffmann</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible electronic skins that simultaneously sense touch and bend are desired in several application areas, such as to cover articulated robot structures. This paper introduces a flexible tactile sensor based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), capable of simultaneously detecting and measuring contact forces and flexion of the sensor. The sensor integrates a magnetic hydrogel composite and utilizes EIT to reconstruct internal conductivity distributions. Real-time estimation is achieved through the one-step Gauss-Newton method, which dynamically updates reference voltages to accommodate sensor deformation. A convolutional neural network is employed to classify interactions, distinguishing between touch, bending, and idle states using pre-reconstructed images. Experimental results demonstrate an average touch localization error of 5.4 mm (SD 2.2 mm) and average bending angle estimation errors of 1.9$^\circ$ (SD 1.6$^\circ$). The proposed adaptive reference method effectively distinguishes between single- and multi-touch scenarios while compensating for deformation effects. This makes the sensor a promising solution for multimodal sensing in robotics and human-robot collaboration.</p>

<h2>GPDFlow: Generative Multivariate Threshold Exceedance Modeling via Normalizing Flows</h2>
<h3>Chenglei Hu, Daniela Castro-Camilo</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multivariate generalized Pareto distribution (mGPD) is a common method for modeling extreme threshold exceedance probabilities in environmental and financial risk management. Despite its broad applicability, mGPD faces challenges due to the infinite possible parametrizations of its dependence function, with only a few parametric models available in practice. To address this limitation, we introduce GPDFlow, an innovative mGPD model that leverages normalizing flows to flexibly represent the dependence structure. Unlike traditional parametric mGPD approaches, GPDFlow does not impose explicit parametric assumptions on dependence, resulting in greater flexibility and enhanced performance. Additionally, GPDFlow allows direct inference of marginal parameters, providing insights into marginal tail behavior. We derive tail dependence coefficients for GPDFlow, including a bivariate formulation, a $d$-dimensional extension, and an alternative measure for partial exceedance dependence. A general relationship between the bivariate tail dependence coefficient and the generative samples from normalizing flows is discussed. Through simulations and a practical application analyzing the risk among five major US banks, we demonstrate that GPDFlow significantly improves modeling accuracy and flexibility compared to traditional parametric methods.</p>

<h2>H-AddiVortes: Heteroscedastic (Bayesian) Additive Voronoi Tessellations</h2>
<h3>Adam J. Stone, John Paul Gosling</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.13037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Heteroscedastic AddiVortes model, a Bayesian non-parametric regression framework that simultaneously models the conditional mean and variance of a response variable using adaptive Voronoi tessellations. By employing a sum-of-tessellations approach for the mean and a product-of-tessellations approach for the variance, the model provides a flexible and interpretable means to capture complex, predictor-dependent relationships and heteroscedastic patterns in data. This dual-layer representation enables precise inference, even in high-dimensional settings, while maintaining computational feasibility through efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and conjugate prior structures. We illustrate the model's capability through both simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to capture nuanced variance structures, provide reliable predictive uncertainty quantification, and highlight key predictors influencing both the mean response and its variability. Empirical results show that the Heteroscedastic AddiVortes model offers a substantial improvement in capturing distributional properties compared to both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic alternatives, making it a robust tool for complex regression problems in various applied settings.</p>
