<h2>Supersingular Ekedahl-Oort strata and Oort's conjecture</h2>
<h3>Valentijn Karemaker, Chia-Fu Yu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2406.19748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}_g$ be the moduli space over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$ of $g$-dimensional principally polarised abelian varieties, where $p$ is a prime. We show that if $g$ is even and $p\geq 5$, then every geometric generic member in the maximal supersingular Ekedahl-Oort stratum in $\mathcal{A}_g$ has automorphism group $\{ \pm 1\}$. This confirms Oort's conjecture in the case of $p\geq 5$ and even $g$. We also separately prove Oort's conjecture for $g=4$ and any prime $p$.</p>

<h2>Integrating Generative AI in Cybersecurity Education: Case Study Insights on Pedagogical Strategies, Critical Thinking, and Responsible AI Use</h2>
<h3>Mahmoud Elkhodr, Ergun Gide</h3>
<p>arXiv:2502.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has introduced new opportunities for transforming higher education, particularly in fields that require analytical reasoning and regulatory compliance, such as cybersecurity management. This study presents a structured framework for integrating GenAI tools into cybersecurity education, demonstrating their role in fostering critical thinking, real-world problem-solving, and regulatory awareness. The implementation strategy followed a two-stage approach, embedding GenAI within tutorial exercises and assessment tasks. Tutorials enabled students to generate, critique, and refine AI-assisted cybersecurity policies, while assessments required them to apply AI-generated outputs to real-world scenarios, ensuring alignment with industry standards and regulatory requirements. Findings indicate that AI-assisted learning significantly enhanced students' ability to evaluate security policies, refine risk assessments, and bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application. Student reflections and instructor observations revealed improvements in analytical engagement, yet challenges emerged regarding AI over-reliance, variability in AI literacy, and the contextual limitations of AI-generated content. Through structured intervention and research-driven refinement, students were able to recognize AI strengths as a generative tool while acknowledging its need for human oversight. This study further highlights the broader implications of AI adoption in cybersecurity education, emphasizing the necessity of balancing automation with expert judgment to cultivate industry-ready professionals. Future research should explore the long-term impact of AI-driven learning on cybersecurity competency, as well as the potential for adaptive AI-assisted assessments to further personalize and enhance educational outcomes.</p>

<h2>SAR models with specific spatial coefficients and heteroskedastic innovations</h2>
<h3>N. A. Cruz, D. A. Romero, O. O. Melo</h3>
<p>arXiv:2502.15580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative extension of spatial autoregressive (SAR) models, introducing spatial coefficients specific to each spatial region that evolve over time. The proposed estimation methodology covers both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic data, ensuring consistency and efficiency in the estimators of the parameters $\pmb{\rho}$ and $\pmb{\beta}$. The model is based on a robust theoretical framework, supported by the analysis of the asymptotic properties of the estimators, which reinforces its practical implementation. To facilitate its use, an algorithm has been developed in the R software, making it a standard tool for the analysis of complex spatial data. The proposed model proves to be more effective than other similar techniques, especially when modeling data with normal spatial structures and non-normal distributions, even when the residuals are not homoscedastic. Finally, the application of the model to homicide rates in the United States highlights its advantages in both statistical and social analysis, positioning it as a key tool for the analysis of spatial data in various disciplines.</p>
