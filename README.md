<h2>Mathematics A Missing Factor in Assessing the Antiquity of Vedanga Jyotisa</h2>
<h3>Jaidev Dasgupta</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reading ancient texts one has to be cognizant of the assumptions made about the past. One has to ask: Are these assumptions valid? Are we projecting the present views into the past? A case in point is the dating of Vedanga Jyotisa. This note reports that due to mathematics being overlooked in the various attempts of assessing the time of composition of the text, the latter was dated much before the period when its mathematics was actually feasible.</p>

Abstract: Tactile sensing is fundamental to robotic systems, enabling interactions through physical contact in multiple tasks. Despite its importance, achieving high-resolution, large-area tactile sensing remains challenging. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) has emerged as a promising approach for large-area, distributed tactile sensing with minimal electrode requirements which can lend itself to addressing complex contact problems in robotics. However, existing EIT-based tactile reconstruction methods often suffer from high computational costs or depend on extensive annotated simulation datasets, hindering its viability in real-world settings. To address this shortcoming, here we propose a Pre-trained Transformer for EIT-based Tactile Reconstruction (PTET), a learning-based framework that bridges the simulation-to-reality gap by leveraging self-supervised pretraining on simulation data and fine-tuning with limited real-world data. In simulations, PTET requires 99.44 percent fewer annotated samples than equivalent state-of-the-art approaches (2,500 vs. 450,000 samples) while achieving reconstruction performance improvements of up to 43.57 percent under identical data conditions. Fine-tuning with real-world data further enables PTET to overcome discrepancies between simulated and experimental datasets, achieving superior reconstruction and detail recovery in practical scenarios. The improved reconstruction accuracy, data efficiency, and robustness in real-world tasks establish it as a scalable and practical solution for tactile sensing systems in robotics, especially for object handling and adaptive grasping under varying pressure conditions.</p>

<h2>High-speed control and navigation for quadrupedal robots on complex and discrete terrain</h2>

<p>arXiv:2506.02835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed legged navigation in discrete and geometrically complex environments is a challenging task because of the high-degree-of-freedom dynamics and long-horizon, nonconvex nature of the optimization problem. In this work, we propose a hierarchical navigation pipeline for legged robots that can traverse such environments at high speed. The proposed pipeline consists of a planner and tracker module. The planner module finds physically feasible foothold plans by sampling-based optimization with fast sequential filtering using heuristics and a neural network. Subsequently, rollouts are performed in a physics simulation to identify the best foothold plan regarding the engineered cost function and to confirm its physical consistency. This hierarchical planning module is computationally efficient and physically accurate at the same time. The tracker aims to accurately step on the target footholds from the planning module. During the training stage, the foothold target distribution is given by a generative model that is trained competitively with the tracker. This process ensures that the tracker is trained in an environment with the desired difficulty. The resulting tracker can overcome terrains that are more difficult than what the previous methods could manage. We demonstrated our approach using Raibo, our in-house dynamic quadruped robot. The results were dynamic and agile motions: Raibo is capable of running on vertical walls, jumping a 1.3-meter gap, running over stepping stones at 4 meters per second, and autonomously navigating on terrains full of 30{\deg} ramps, stairs, and boxes of various sizes.</p>

<h2>LLMs can Find Mathematical Reasoning Mistakes by Pedagogical Chain-of-Thought</h2>
<h3>Zhuoxuan Jiang, Haoyuan Peng, Shanshan Feng, Fan Li, Dongsheng Li</h3>
<p>arXiv:2405.06705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-correction is emerging as a promising approach to mitigate the issue of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate effective self-correction, recent research has proposed mistake detection as its initial step. However, current literature suggests that LLMs often struggle with reliably identifying reasoning mistakes when using simplistic prompting strategies. To address this challenge, we introduce a unique prompting strategy, termed the Pedagogical Chain-of-Thought (PedCoT), which is specifically designed to guide the identification of reasoning mistakes, particularly mathematical reasoning mistakes. PedCoT consists of pedagogical principles for prompts (PPP) design, two-stage interaction process (TIP) and grounded PedCoT prompts, all inspired by the educational theory of the Bloom Cognitive Model (BCM). We evaluate our approach on two public datasets featuring math problems of varying difficulty levels. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prompting strategy significantly outperforms strong baselines. The proposed method can achieve the goal of reliable mathematical mistake identification and provide a foundation for automatic math answer grading. The results underscore the significance of educational theory, serving as domain knowledge, in guiding prompting strategy design for addressing challenging tasks with LLMs effectively.</p>

<h2>STATE-NAV: Stability-Aware Traversability Estimation for Bipedal Navigation on Rough Terrain</h2>
<h3>Ziwon Yoon, Lawrence Y. Zhu, Lu Gan, Ye Zhao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.01046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipedal robots have advantages in maneuvering human-centered environments, but face greater failure risk compared to other stable mobile plarforms such as wheeled or quadrupedal robots. While learning-based traversability has been widely studied for these platforms, bipedal traversability has instead relied on manually designed rules with limited consideration of locomotion stability on rough terrain. In this work, we present the first learning-based traversability estimation and risk-sensitive navigation framework for bipedal robots operating in diverse, uneven environments. TravFormer, a transformer-based neural network, is trained to predict bipedal instability with uncertainty, enabling risk-aware and adaptive planning. Based on the network, we define traversability as stability-aware command velocity-the fastest command velocity that keeps instability below a user-defined limit. This velocity-based traversability is integrated into a hierarchical planner that combines traversability-informed Rapid Random Tree Star (TravRRT*) for time-efficient planning and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for safe execution. We validate our method in MuJoCo simulation, demonstrating improved navigation performance, with enhanced robustness and time efficiency across varying terrains compared to existing methods.</p>
