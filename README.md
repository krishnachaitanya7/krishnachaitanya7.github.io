<h2>Optimal Transport for $\epsilon$-Contaminated Credal Sets: To the Memory of Sayan Mukherjee</h2>
<h3>Michele Caprio</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.03267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present generalized versions of Monge's and Kantorovich's optimal transport problems with the probabilities being transported replaced by lower probabilities. We show that, when the lower probabilities are the lower envelopes of $\epsilon$-contaminated sets, then our version of Monge's, and a restricted version of our Kantorovich's problems, coincide with their respective classical versions. We also give sufficient conditions for the existence of our version of Kantorovich's optimal plan, and for the two problems to be equivalent. As a byproduct, we show that for $\epsilon$-contaminations the lower probability versions of Monge's and Kantorovich's optimal transport problems need not coincide. The applications of our results to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are also discussed.</p>

<h2>CPG-EVAL: A Multi-Tiered Benchmark for Evaluating the Chinese Pedagogical Grammar Competence of Large Language Models</h2>
<h3>Dong Wang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2504.13261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has significantly impacted foreign language education, yet their pedagogical grammar competence remains under-assessed. This paper introduces CPG-EVAL, the first dedicated benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of pedagogical grammar within the context of foreign language instruction. Methodology: The benchmark comprises five tasks designed to assess grammar recognition, fine-grained grammatical distinction, categorical discrimination, and resistance to linguistic interference. Findings: Smaller-scale models can succeed in single language instance tasks, but struggle with multiple instance tasks and interference from confusing instances. Larger-scale models show better resistance to interference but still have significant room for accuracy improvement. The evaluation indicates the need for better instructional alignment and more rigorous benchmarks, to effectively guide the deployment of LLMs in educational contexts. Value: This study offers the first specialized, theory-driven, multi-tiered benchmark framework for systematically evaluating LLMs' pedagogical grammar competence in Chinese language teaching contexts. CPG-EVAL not only provides empirical insights for educators, policymakers, and model developers to better gauge AI's current abilities in educational settings, but also lays the groundwork for future research on improving model alignment, enhancing educational suitability, and ensuring informed decision-making concerning LLM integration in foreign language instruction.</p>

<p>arXiv:2504.13672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climbing robots hold significant promise for applications such as industrial inspection and maintenance, particularly in hazardous or hard-to-reach environments. This paper describes the quadrupedal climbing robot Magnecko, developed with the major goal of providing a research platform for legged climbing locomotion. With its 12 actuated degrees of freedom arranged in an insect-style joint configuration, Magnecko's high manipulability and high range of motion allow it to handle challenging environments like overcoming concave 90 degree corners. A model predictive controller enables Magnecko to crawl on the ground on horizontal overhangs and on vertical walls. Thanks to the custom actuators and the electro-permanent magnets that are used for adhesion on ferrous surfaces, the system is powerful enough to carry additional payloads of at least 65 percent of its own weight in all orientations. The Magnecko platform serves as a foundation for climbing locomotion in complex three-dimensional environments.</p>

<h2>Modeling L1 Influence on L2 Pronunciation: An MFCC-Based Framework for Explainable Machine Learning and Pedagogical Feedback</h2>
<h3>Peyman Jahanbin</h3>
<p>arXiv:2504.13765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) capture first language (L1) transfer in extended second language (L2) English speech. Speech samples from Mandarin and American English L1 speakers were extracted from the GMU Speech Accent Archive, converted to WAV format, and processed to obtain thirteen MFCCs per speaker. A multi-method analytic framework combining inferential statistics (t-tests, MANOVA, Canonical Discriminant Analysis) and machine learning (Random Forest classification) identified MFCC-1 (broadband energy), MFCC-2 (first formant region), and MFCC-5 (voicing and fricative energy) as the most discriminative features for distinguishing L1 backgrounds. A reduced-feature model using these MFCCs significantly outperformed the full-feature model, as confirmed by McNemar's test and non-overlapping confidence intervals. The findings empirically support the Perceptual Assimilation Model for L2 (PAM-L2) and the Speech Learning Model (SLM), demonstrating that L1-conditioned variation in L2 speech is both perceptually grounded and acoustically quantifiable. Methodologically, the study contributes to applied linguistics and explainable AI by proposing a transparent, data-efficient pipeline for L2 pronunciation modeling. The results also offer pedagogical implications for ESL/EFL instruction by highlighting L1-specific features that can inform intelligibility-oriented instruction, curriculum design, and speech assessment tools.</p>
