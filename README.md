Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated remarkable agility and robustness in traversing complex terrains. However, they remain limited in performing object interactions that require sustained contact. In this work, we present LocoTouch, a system that equips quadrupedal robots with tactile sensing to address a challenging task in this category: long-distance transport of unsecured cylindrical objects, which typically requires custom mounting mechanisms to maintain stability. For efficient large-area tactile sensing, we design a high-density distributed tactile sensor array that covers the entire back of the robot. To effectively leverage tactile feedback for locomotion control, we develop a simulation environment with high-fidelity tactile signals, and train tactile-aware transport policies using a two-stage learning pipeline. Furthermore, we design a novel reward function to promote stable, symmetric, and frequency-adaptive locomotion gaits. After training in simulation, LocoTouch transfers zero-shot to the real world, reliably balancing and transporting a wide range of unsecured, cylindrical everyday objects with broadly varying sizes and weights. Thanks to the responsiveness of the tactile sensor and the adaptive gait reward, LocoTouch can robustly balance objects with slippery surfaces over long distances, or even under severe external perturbations.</p>

Abstract: The field of environmental epidemiology has placed an increasing emphasis on understanding the health effects of mixtures of metals, chemicals, and pollutants in recent years. Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) is a statistical method that has gained significant traction in environmental mixture studies due to its ability to account for complex non-linear relationships between the exposures and health outcome and its ability to identify interaction effects between the exposures. However, BKMR makes the crucial assumption that the error terms have a constant variance, and this assumption is not typically checked in practice. In this paper, we create a diagnostic function for checking this constant variance assumption in practice and develop Heteroscedastic BKMR (HBKMR) for environmental mixture analyses where this assumption is not met. By specifying a Bayesian hierarchical variance model for the error term variance parameters, HBKMR produces updated estimates of the environmental mixture's health effects and their corresponding 95% credible intervals. We apply HBKMR in two real-world case studies that motivated this work: 1) Examining the effects of prenatal metal exposures on behavioral problems in toddlers living in Suriname and 2) Assessing the impacts of metal exposures on simple reaction time in children living near coal-fired power plants in Kentucky. In both case studies, HBKMR provides a substantial improvement in model fit compared to BKMR, with differences in some of the mixture effect estimates and typically narrower 95% credible intervals after accounting for the heteroscedasticity.</p>
