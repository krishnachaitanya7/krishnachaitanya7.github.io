<h2>The effect of predation on the dynamics of Chronic Wasting Disease in deer</h2>
<h3>Cody E. FitzGerald, James P. Keener</h3>
<p>arXiv:2509.00134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a neurological disease impacting deer, elk, moose, and other cervid populations and is caused by a misfolded protein known as a prion. CWD is difficult to control due to the persistence of prions in the environment. Prions can remain infectious for more than a decade and have been found in soil as well as other environmental vectors, such as ticks and plants. Here, we provide a bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of CWD spread in a cervid population, and use a modification of the Gillespie algorithm to explore if wolves can be used as an ecological control strategy to limit the spread of the disease in several relevant scenarios. We then analytically compute the probability that the disease spreads given one infected member enters a fully healthy population and the probability of elimination, given a fully susceptible population and remaining prions in the environment. From our analysis, we conclude that wolves can be used as an effective control strategy to limit the spread of CWD in cervid populations, and hunting or other means of lowering the susceptible population are beneficial to controlling the spread of CWD, although it is important to note that inferring biologically relevant parameters from the existing data is an ongoing challenge for this system.</p>

Abstract: Traditional RL-based locomotion controllers often suffer from low data efficiency, requiring extensive interaction to achieve robust performance. We present a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework that improves sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion by appending synthetic data to the end of standard rollouts in PPO-based controllers, following the Dyna-Style paradigm. A predictive model, trained alongside the policy, generates short-horizon synthetic transitions that are gradually integrated using a scheduling strategy based on the policy update iterations. Through an ablation study, we identified a strong correlation between sample efficiency and rollout length, which guided the design of our experiments. We validated our approach in simulation on the Unitree Go1 robot and showed that replacing part of the simulated steps with synthetic ones not only mimics extended rollouts but also improves policy return and reduces variance. Finally, we demonstrate that this improvement transfers to the ability to track a wide range of locomotion commands using fewer simulated steps.</p>

<h2>Projection-based model-order reduction via graph autoencoders suited for unstructured meshes</h2>

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a graph autoencoder architecture capable of performing projection-based model-order reduction (PMOR) using a nonlinear manifold least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG) projection scheme. The architecture is particularly useful for advection-dominated flows modeled by unstructured meshes, as it provides a robust nonlinear mapping that can be leveraged in a PMOR setting. The presented graph autoencoder is constructed with a two-part process that consists of (1) generating a hierarchy of reduced graphs to emulate the compressive abilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and (2) training a message passing operation at each step in the hierarchy of reduced graphs to emulate the filtering process of a CNN. The resulting framework provides improved flexibility over traditional CNN-based autoencoders because it is readily extendable to unstructured meshes. We provide an analysis of the interpretability of the graph autoencoder's latent state variables, where we find that the Jacobian of the decoder for the proposed graph autoencoder provides interpretable mode shapes akin to traditional proper orthogonal decomposition modes. To highlight the capabilities of the proposed framework, which is named geometric deep least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (GD-LSPG), we benchmark the method on a one-dimensional Burgers' model with a structured mesh and demonstrate the flexibility of GD-LSPG by deploying it on two test cases for two-dimensional Euler equations that use an unstructured mesh. The proposed framework is more flexible than using a traditional CNN-based autoencoder and provides considerable improvement in accuracy for very low-dimensional latent spaces in comparison with traditional affine projections.</p>

<h2>Bipedal Balance Control with Whole-body Musculoskeletal Standing and Falling Simulations</h2>

<p>arXiv:2506.09383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention, quantitative understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This work presents a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via a comprehensive whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal dynamics of balancing during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle injury on balancing behavior, and generated fall contact patterns that aligned with clinical data. Furthermore, our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance and reduced muscle effort under perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level insights into human balance dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally. It could provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals with balance impairments and support the advancement of humanoid robotic systems.</p>

<h2>Skill-Nav: Enhanced Navigation with Versatile Quadrupedal Locomotion via Waypoint Interface</h2>

<p>arXiv:2506.21853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated exceptional locomotion capabilities through Reinforcement Learning (RL), including extreme parkour maneuvers. However, integrating locomotion skills with navigation in quadrupedal robots has not been fully investigated, which holds promise for enhancing long-distance movement capabilities. In this paper, we propose Skill-Nav, a method that incorporates quadrupedal locomotion skills into a hierarchical navigation framework using waypoints as an interface. Specifically, we train a waypoint-guided locomotion policy using deep RL, enabling the robot to autonomously adjust its locomotion skills to reach targeted positions while avoiding obstacles. Compared with direct velocity commands, waypoints offer a simpler yet more flexible interface for high-level planning and low-level control. Utilizing waypoints as the interface allows for the application of various general planning tools, such as large language models (LLMs) and path planning algorithms, to guide our locomotion policy in traversing terrains with diverse obstacles. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate that Skill-Nav can effectively traverse complex terrains and complete challenging navigation tasks.</p>

<h2>Grid impedance estimation based Kalman Filter</h2>
<h3>Phuoc Sang Nguyen, Ghavameddin Nourbakhsh, Gerard Ledwich</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.17325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern power systems face new operational hurdles due to the increasing adoption of inverter-coupled distributed energy resources, which impact system stability and control. Central to these challenges is the dynamic nature of grid impedance. To address this, a novel real-time estimation algorithm based on the Discrete Fourier Transform is proposed. This algorithm is embedded within an Advanced Angle Estimation Kalman Filter framework that employs a Linear Quadratic Regulator for current control (AAEKF-LQR). The impedance data directly informs and refines the controller's phase angle estimation. Simulation analyses demonstrate robust collaboration between the estimator and controller, sustaining system stability under weak grid conditions. The technique proves capable of delivering swift and accurate impedance updates during grid variations, which is crucial for maintaining stable inverter operation</p>
