Abstract: Heteroskedasticity testing in nonparametric regression is a classic statistical problem with important practical applications, yet fundamental limits are unknown. Adopting a minimax perspective, this article considers the testing problem in the context of an $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder mean and a $\beta$-H\"{o}lder variance function. For $\alpha > 0$ and $\beta \in (0, 1/2)$, the sharp minimax separation rate $n^{-4\alpha} + n^{-4\beta/(4\beta+1)} + n^{-2\beta}$ is established. To achieve the minimax separation rate, a kernel-based statistic using first-order squared differences is developed. Notably, the statistic estimates a proxy rather than a natural quadratic functional (the squared distance between the variance function and its best $L^2$ approximation by a constant) suggested in previous work.
  The setting where no smoothness is assumed on the variance function is also studied; the variance profile across the design points can be arbitrary. Despite the lack of structure, consistent testing turns out to still be possible by using the Gaussian character of the noise, and the minimax rate is shown to be $n^{-4\alpha} + n^{-1/2}$. Exploiting noise information happens to be a fundamental necessity as consistent testing is impossible if nothing more than zero mean and unit variance is known about the noise distribution. Furthermore, in the setting where the variance function is $\beta$-H\"{o}lder but heteroskedasticity is measured only with respect to the design points, the minimax separation rate is shown to be $n^{-4\alpha} + n^{-\left((1/2) \vee (4\beta/(4\beta+1))\right)}$ when the noise is Gaussian and $n^{-4\alpha} + n^{-4\beta/(4\beta+1)} + n^{-2\beta}$ when the noise distribution is unknown.</p>

Abstract: The expressive power of message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) is reasonably well understood, primarily through combinatorial techniques from graph isomorphism testing. However, MPNNs' generalization abilities -- making meaningful predictions beyond the training set -- remain less explored. Current generalization analyses often overlook graph structure, limit the focus to specific aggregation functions, and assume the impractical, hard-to-optimize $0$-$1$ loss function. Here, we extend recent advances in graph similarity theory to assess the influence of graph structure, aggregation, and loss functions on MPNNs' generalization abilities. Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, improving our understanding of MPNNs' generalization properties.</p>

<h2>Explainable machine learning for neoplasms diagnosis via electrocardiograms: an externally validated study</h2>
<h3>Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Wilhelm Haverkamp, Nils Strodthoff</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.07737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Neoplasms remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with timely diagnosis being crucial for improving patient outcomes. Current diagnostic methods are often invasive, costly, and inaccessible to many populations. Electrocardiogram (ECG) data, widely available and non-invasive, has the potential to serve as a tool for neoplasms diagnosis by using physiological changes in cardiovascular function associated with neoplastic prescences.
  Methods: This study explores the application of machine learning models to analyze ECG features for the diagnosis of neoplasms. We developed a pipeline integrating tree-based models with Shapley values for explainability. The model was trained and internally validated and externally validated on a second large-scale independent external cohort to ensure robustness and generalizability.
  Findings: The results demonstrate that ECG data can effectively capture neoplasms-associated cardiovascular changes, achieving high performance in both internal testing and external validation cohorts. Shapley values identified key ECG features influencing model predictions, revealing established and novel cardiovascular markers linked to neoplastic conditions. This non-invasive approach provides a cost-effective and scalable alternative for the diagnosis of neoplasms, particularly in resource-limited settings. Similarly, useful for the management of secondary cardiovascular effects given neoplasms therapies.
  Interpretation: This study highlights the feasibility of leveraging ECG signals and machine learning to enhance neoplasms diagnostics. By offering interpretable insights into cardio-neoplasms interactions, this approach bridges existing gaps in non-invasive diagnostics and has implications for integrating ECG-based tools into broader neoplasms diagnostic frameworks, as well as neoplasms therapy management.</p>
