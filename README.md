<h2>A low-rank non-convex norm method for multiview graph clustering</h2>

<p>arXiv:2312.11157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel technique for multi-view clustering known as the "Consensus Graph-Based Multi-View Clustering Method Using Low-Rank Non-Convex Norm" (CGMVC-NC). Multi-view clustering is a challenging task in machine learning as it requires the integration of information from multiple data sources or views to cluster data points accurately. The suggested approach makes use of the structural characteristics of multi-view data tensors, introducing a non-convex tensor norm to identify correlations between these views. In contrast to conventional methods, this approach demonstrates superior clustering accuracy across several benchmark datasets. Despite the non-convex nature of the tensor norm used, the proposed method remains amenable to efficient optimization using existing algorithms. The approach provides a valuable tool for multi-view data analysis and has the potential to enhance our understanding of complex systems in various fields. Further research can explore the application of this method to other types of data and extend it to other machine-learning tasks.</p>

<h2>Safe and Optimal Variable Impedance Control via Certified Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<h3>Shreyas Kumar, Ravi Prakash</h3>
<p>arXiv:2511.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful approach for robots to learn complex, collaborative skills by combining Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) for motion and Variable Impedance Control (VIC) for compliant interaction. However, this model-free paradigm often risks instability and unsafe exploration due to the time-varying nature of impedance gains. This work introduces Certified Gaussian Manifold Sampling (C-GMS), a novel trajectory-centric RL framework that learns combined DMP and VIC policies while guaranteeing Lyapunov stability and actuator feasibility by construction. Our approach reframes policy exploration as sampling from a mathematically defined manifold of stable gain schedules. This ensures every policy rollout is guaranteed to be stable and physically realizable, thereby eliminating the need for reward penalties or post-hoc validation. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our approach ensures bounded tracking error even in the presence of bounded model errors and deployment-time uncertainties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of C-GMS in simulation and verify its efficacy on a real robot, paving the way for reliable autonomous interaction in complex environments.</p>

<h2>Ultra-Low Insertion Loss Stepped Impedance Resonator Topology for HTSC RF Front-End</h2>
<h3>Ilan Kurtser, Yoav Koral, Eldad Holdengreber, Shmuel E. Schacham, Eliyahu Farber</h3>
<p>arXiv:2511.14447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and measurement of a high-temperature superconductor (HTSC) Stepped Impedance Resonator (SIR) band-pass filter for S-band applications, and its incorporation into a cryogenic receiver cascade. The 11-pole filter, implemented in YBa2Cu3O(7-x) (YBCO) thin films on sapphire, exhibits an ultra-low insertion loss (IL) of -0.1~dB, a sharp roll-off of 100~MHz, and a rejection level exceeding --80~dB. These measured results represent, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest reported IL for an S-band filter with this number of poles. When integrated with a cryogenic low-noise amplifier (LNA), system-level simulations and measurements predict a receiver noise figure (NF) of 0.34~dB at 3.39~GHz, enabling a 20% increase in radar detection range compared with conventional copper-based front ends. This work demonstrates the feasibility of practical HTSC-based RF front-ends for next-generation communication and radar systems.</p>

<h2>Explainable machine learning for neoplasms diagnosis via electrocardiograms: an externally validated study</h2>
<h3>Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Wilhelm Haverkamp, Nils Strodthoff</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.07737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Neoplasms are a major cause of mortality globally, where early diagnosis is essential for improving outcomes. Current diagnostic methods are often invasive, expensive, and inaccessible in resource-limited settings. This study explores the potential of electrocardiogram (ECG) data, a widely available and non-invasive tool for diagnosing neoplasms through cardiovascular changes linked to neoplastic presence.
  Methods: A diagnostic pipeline combining tree-based machine learning models with Shapley value analysis for explainability was developed. The model was trained and internally validated on a large dataset and externally validated on an independent cohort to ensure robustness and generalizability. Key ECG features contributing to predictions were identified and analyzed.
  Results: The model achieved high diagnostic accuracy in both internal testing and external validation cohorts. Shapley value analysis highlighted significant ECG features, including novel predictors. The approach is cost-effective, scalable, and suitable for resource-limited settings, offering insights into cardiovascular changes associated with neoplasms and their therapies.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using ECG signals and machine learning for non-invasive neoplasm diagnosis. By providing interpretable insights into cardio-neoplasm interactions, this method addresses gaps in diagnostics and supports integration into broader diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks.</p>
