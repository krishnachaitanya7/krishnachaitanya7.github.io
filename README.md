<h2>Fast reaction limit for a Leslie-Gower model including preys, meso-predators and top-predators</h2>
<h3>Desvillettes Laurent, Fiorentino Ludovica, Mautone Teresa</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.07474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of three reaction-diffusion equations modeling the interaction between a prey species and two predators species including functional responses of Holly type-II and Leslie-Gower type. We propose a reaction-diffusion model with five equations with simpler functional responses which, in the fast reaction limit, allows to recover the zero-th order terms of the initially considered system. The diffusive part of the initial equations is however modified and cross diffusion terms pop up.
  We first study the equilibria of this new system and show that no Turing instability appears. We then rigorously prove a partial result of convergence for the fast reaction limit (in 1D and 2D)</p>

<h2>Lemme de Yoneda pour les foncteurs \`a valeurs monoidales</h2>
<h3>Fethi Kadhi</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.07766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a closed symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{M}$. We show that if $I$ is a small category then $\mathcal{M}^I$ is a closed $\mathcal{M}$-module. We rewrite the Yoneda Lemma in the case of monoidal valued functors. We derive an adjoint functor theorem and we show that $\mathcal{M}^I$ is a closed symmetric monoidal category</p>

<h2>Parametric probabilistic approach for cumulative fatigue damage using double linear damage rule considering limited data</h2>
<h3>Jo\~ao Paulo Dias, Stephen Ekwaro-Osire, Americo Cunha Jr, Shweta Dabetwar, Abraham Nispel, Fisseha M. Alemayehu, Haileyesus B. Endeshaw</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a parametric probabilistic approach to model damage accumulation using the double linear damage rule (DLDR) considering the existence of limited experimental fatigue data. A probabilistic version of DLDR is developed in which the joint distribution of the knee-point coordinates is obtained as a function of the joint distribution of the DLDR model input parameters. Considering information extracted from experiments containing a limited number of data points, an uncertainty quantification framework based on the Maximum Entropy Principle and Monte Carlo simulations is proposed to determine the distribution of fatigue life. The proposed approach is validated using fatigue life experiments available in the literature.</p>

<h2>Towards Quantifying The Privacy Of Redacted Text</h2>
<h3>Vaibhav Gusain, Douglas Leith</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose use of a k-anonymity-like approach for evaluating the privacy of redacted text. Given a piece of redacted text we use a state of the art transformer-based deep learning network to reconstruct the original text. This generates multiple full texts that are consistent with the redacted text, i.e. which are grammatical, have the same non-redacted words etc, and represents each of these using an embedding vector that captures sentence similarity. In this way we can estimate the number, diversity and quality of full text consistent with the redacted text and so evaluate privacy.</p>

<h2>SwarmPath: Drone Swarm Navigation through Cluttered Environments Leveraging Artificial Potential Field and Impedance Control</h2>
<h3>Roohan Ahmed Khan, Malaika Zafar, Amber Batool, Aleksey Fedoseev, Dzmitry Tsetserukou</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the area of multi-drone systems, navigating through dynamic environments from start to goal while providing collision-free trajectory and efficient path planning is a significant challenge. To solve this problem, we propose a novel SwarmPath technology that involves the integration of Artificial Potential Field (APF) with Impedance Controller. The proposed approach provides a solution based on collision free leader-follower behaviour where drones are able to adapt themselves to the environment. Moreover, the leader is virtual while drones are physical followers leveraging APF path planning approach to find the smallest possible path to the target. Simultaneously, the drones dynamically adjust impedance links, allowing themselves to create virtual links with obstacles to avoid them. As compared to conventional APF, the proposed SwarmPath system not only provides smooth collision-avoidance but also enable agents to efficiently pass through narrow passages by reducing the total travel time by 30% while ensuring safety in terms of drones connectivity. Lastly, the results also illustrate that the discrepancies between simulated and real environment, exhibit an average absolute percentage error (APE) of 6% of drone trajectories. This underscores the reliability of our solution in real-world scenarios.</p>
