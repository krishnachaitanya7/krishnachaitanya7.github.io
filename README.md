Abstract: We propose a novel Graph Neural Network-based method for segmentation based on data fusion of multimodal Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images. In most cases, Backscattered Electron (BSE) images obtained using SEM do not contain sufficient information for mineral segmentation. Therefore, imaging is often complemented with point-wise Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) spectral measurements that provide highly accurate information about the chemical composition but that are time-consuming to acquire. This motivates the use of sparse spectral data in conjunction with BSE images for mineral segmentation. The unstructured nature of the spectral data makes most traditional image fusion techniques unsuitable for BSE-EDS fusion. We propose using graph neural networks to fuse the two modalities and segment the mineral phases simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that providing EDS data for as few as 1% of BSE pixels produces accurate segmentation, enabling rapid analysis of mineral samples. The proposed data fusion pipeline is versatile and can be adapted to other domains that involve image data and point-wise measurements.</p>

Abstract: After its introduction, impedance control has been utilized as a primary control scheme for robotic manipulation tasks that involve interaction with unknown environments. While impedance control has been extensively studied, the geometric structure of SE(3) for the robotic manipulator itself and its use in formulating a robotic task has not been adequately addressed. In this paper, we propose a differential geometric approach to impedance control. Given a left-invariant error metric in SE(3), the corresponding error vectors in position and velocity are first derived. We then propose the impedance control schemes that adequately account for the geometric structure of the manipulator in SE(3) based on a left-invariant potential function. The closed-loop stabilities for the proposed control schemes are verified using Lyapunov function-based analysis. The proposed control design clearly outperformed a conventional impedance control approach when tracking challenging trajectory profiles.</p>

<h2>Demo of picoRing mouse: an ultra-low-powered wireless mouse ring with ring-to-wristband coil-based impedance sensing</h2>

<p>arXiv:2501.16674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless mouse rings offer subtle, reliable pointing interactions for wearable computing platforms, but the small battery below 27 mAh in the miniature rings restricts the ring's continuous lifespan to just 1-2 hours due to the power consumption of current low-powered wireless communication like BLE. However, the picoRing mouse addresses this by enabling continuous ring-based mouse interaction with ultra-low-powered ring-to-wristband wireless communication through a coil-based impedance sensing method called semi-passive inductive telemetry. This allows a wristband coil to capture a unique frequency response of a nearby ring coil via sensitive inductive coupling, converting the user's mouse input into the unique frequency response via an 820 uW mouse-driven modulation module. Thus, the continuous use of picoRing mouse can potentially last over 92 hours on a single charge of a 20 mAh battery while supporting subtle scrolling and pressing interactions.</p>
