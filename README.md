<h2>Global dynamics and integrability of a Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with linear functional response and generalist predator</h2>
<h3>Martha Alvarez-Ram\'irez, Johanna D. Garc\'ia-Salda\~na, Mario Medina</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.10104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with a Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with a generalist or alternating food for predator and linear functional response. Using a topological equivalent polynomial system we prove that the system is not Liouvillian (hence also not Darboux) integrable. In order to study the global dynamics of this model, we use the Poincar\'e compactification of $\mathbb{R}^2$ to characterize all phase portraits in the Poincar\'e disc, obtaining two different topological phase portraits.</p>

<h2>Deflated HeteroPCA: Overcoming the curse of ill-conditioning in heteroskedastic PCA</h2>
<h3>Yuchen Zhou, Yuxin Chen</h3>
<p>arXiv:2303.06198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with estimating the column subspace of a low-rank matrix $\boldsymbol{X}^\star \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1\times n_2}$ from contaminated data. How to obtain optimal statistical accuracy while accommodating the widest range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) becomes particularly challenging in the presence of heteroskedastic noise and unbalanced dimensionality (i.e., $n_2\gg n_1$). While the state-of-the-art algorithm $\textsf{HeteroPCA}$ emerges as a powerful solution for solving this problem, it suffers from "the curse of ill-conditioning," namely, its performance degrades as the condition number of $\boldsymbol{X}^\star$ grows. In order to overcome this critical issue without compromising the range of allowable SNRs, we propose a novel algorithm, called $\textsf{Deflated-HeteroPCA}$, that achieves near-optimal and condition-number-free theoretical guarantees in terms of both $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{2,\infty}$ statistical accuracy. The proposed algorithm divides the spectrum of $\boldsymbol{X}^\star$ into well-conditioned and mutually well-separated subblocks, and applies $\textsf{HeteroPCA}$ to conquer each subblock successively. Further, an application of our algorithm and theory to two canonical examples -- the factor model and tensor PCA -- leads to remarkable improvement for each application.</p>

<h2>Learning Bipedal Walking for Humanoid Robots in Challenging Environments with Obstacle Avoidance</h2>

<p>arXiv:2410.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has seen successful implementations on humanoid robots to achieve dynamic walking. However, these implementations have been so far successful in simple environments void of obstacles. In this paper, we aim to achieve bipedal locomotion in an environment where obstacles are present using a policy-based reinforcement learning. By adding simple distance reward terms to a state of art reward function that can achieve basic bipedal locomotion, the trained policy succeeds in navigating the robot towards the desired destination without colliding with the obstacles along the way.</p>

<h2>Compressing regularised dynamics improves link prediction in sparse networks</h2>
<h3>Maja Lindstr\"om, Christopher Bl\"ocker, Tommy L\"ofstedt, Martin Rosvall</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting future interactions or novel links in networks is an indispensable tool across diverse domains, including genetic research, online social networks, and recommendation systems. Among the numerous techniques developed for link prediction, those leveraging the networks' community structure have proven highly effective. For example, the recently proposed MapSim predicts links based on a similarity measure derived from the code structure of the map equation, a community-detection objective function that operates on network flows. However, the standard map equation assumes complete observations and typically identifies many small modules in networks where the nodes connect through only a few links. This aspect can degrade MapSim's performance on sparse networks. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate a global regularisation method based on a Bayesian estimate of the transition rates along with three local regularisation methods. The regularised versions of the map equation compensate for incomplete observations and decrease the number of identified communities in sparse networks. The regularised methods outperform standard MapSim and several state-of-the-art embedding methods in highly sparse networks. This performance holds across multiple real-world networks with randomly removed links, simulating incomplete observations. Among the proposed regularisation methods, the global regularisation method provides the most reliable community detection and the highest link prediction performance across different network densities.</p>
