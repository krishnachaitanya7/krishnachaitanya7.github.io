<h2>Towards graph neural networks for provably solving convex optimization problems</h2>
<h3>Chendi Qian, Christopher Morris</h3>
<p>arXiv:2502.02446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have shown potential for solving combinatorial and continuous optimization problems due to their ability to capture variable-constraint interactions. While existing approaches leverage MPNNs to approximate solutions or warm-start traditional solvers, they often lack guarantees for feasibility, particularly in convex optimization settings. Here, we propose an iterative MPNN framework to solve convex optimization problems with provable feasibility guarantees. First, we demonstrate that MPNNs can provably simulate standard interior-point methods for solving quadratic problems with linear constraints, covering relevant problems such as SVMs. Secondly, to ensure feasibility, we introduce a variant that starts from a feasible point and iteratively restricts the search within the feasible region. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing neural baselines in solution quality and feasibility, generalizes well to unseen problem sizes, and, in some cases, achieves faster solution times than state-of-the-art solvers such as Gurobi.</p>

<h2>Heteroscedastic Double Bayesian Elastic Net</h2>
<h3>Masanari Kimura</h3>
<p>arXiv:2502.02032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many practical applications, regression models are employed to uncover relationships between predictors and a response variable, yet the common assumption of constant error variance is frequently violated. This issue is further compounded in high-dimensional settings where the number of predictors exceeds the sample size, necessitating regularization for effective estimation and variable selection. To address this problem, we propose the Heteroscedastic Double Bayesian Elastic Net (HDBEN), a novel framework that jointly models the mean and log-variance using hierarchical Bayesian priors incorporating both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ penalties. Our approach simultaneously induces sparsity and grouping in the regression coefficients and variance parameters, capturing complex variance structures in the data. Theoretical results demonstrate that proposed HDBEN achieves posterior concentration, variable selection consistency, and asymptotic normality under mild conditions which justifying its behavior. Simulation studies further illustrate that HDBEN outperforms existing methods, particularly in scenarios characterized by heteroscedasticity and high dimensionality.</p>

<h2>A Brief Analysis of the Iterative Next Boundary Detection Network for Tree Rings Delineation in Images of Pinus taeda</h2>
<h3>Henry Marichal, Gregory Randall</h3>
<p>arXiv:2408.14343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the INBD network proposed by Gillert et al. in CVPR-2023 and studies its application for delineating tree rings in RGB images of Pinus taeda cross sections captured by a smartphone (UruDendro dataset), which are images with different characteristics from the ones used to train the method. The INBD network operates in two stages: first, it segments the background, pith, and ring boundaries. In the second stage, the image is transformed into polar coordinates, and ring boundaries are iteratively segmented from the pith to the bark. Both stages are based on the U-Net architecture. The method achieves an F-Score of 77.5, a mAR of 0.540, and an ARAND of 0.205 on the evaluation set. The code for the experiments is available at https://github.com/hmarichal93/mlbrief_inbd.</p>
