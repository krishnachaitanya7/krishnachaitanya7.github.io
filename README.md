<h2>Periodicity in delayed self-regulation is a predator-prey process</h2>
<h3>Alejandro L\'opez-Nieto</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unify two different periodicity mechanisms: delayed self-regulation and planar predator-prey feedback. We consider scalar delay differential equations $\dot x(t) = rf(x(t), x(t - 1))$ where $f$ is monotone in the delayed component. Due to a Poincar\'{e}--Bendixson theorem for monotone delayed feedback systems, the typical global dynamics present periodic orbits as the delay parameter $r$ increases. In this article, we show that, as we vary the delay, each connected component of periodic orbits is an annulus with global coordinates given by the time and the amplitude of the corresponding periodic solutions. On each annulus, the variables $x(t)$ and $x(t - 1)$ solve an integrable ordinary differential equation that satisfies a predator-prey feedback relation. Moreover, we completely characterize the set of periodic solutions of the delay differential equation in terms of two time maps generated by the underlying predator-prey system.</p>

Abstract: Operando impedance measurements are promising for monitoring batteries in the field. In this work, we present pseudo-random sequences for low-cost operando battery impedance measurements. The quadratic-residue ternary sequence and direct-synthesis ternary sequence exhibit specific properties related to eigenvectors of the discrete Fourier transform matrix that allow computationally efficient compensation for drifts and transients in operando impedance measurements. We describe the application of pseudo-random sequences and provide the data processing required to suppress drift and transients, validated on simulations. Finally, we perform experimental operando impedance measurements on a Li-ion battery cell during fast-charging, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method. It's low-cost hardware requirements, fast measurements, and simple data-processing make the method practical for embedding in battery management systems.</p>

<h2>Intent Matters: Enhancing AI Tutoring with Fine-Grained Pedagogical Intent Annotation</h2>
<h3>Kseniia Petukhova, Ekaterina Kochmar</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for educational applications, particularly in intelligent tutoring systems. However, effective tutoring requires alignment with pedagogical strategies - something current LLMs lack without task-specific adaptation. In this work, we explore whether fine-grained annotation of teacher intents can improve the quality of LLM-generated tutoring responses. We focus on MathDial, a dialog dataset for math instruction, and apply an automated annotation framework to re-annotate a portion of the dataset using a detailed taxonomy of eleven pedagogical intents. We then fine-tune an LLM using these new annotations and compare its performance to models trained on the original four-category taxonomy. Both automatic and qualitative evaluations show that the fine-grained model produces more pedagogically aligned and effective responses. Our findings highlight the value of intent specificity for controlled text generation in educational settings, and we release our annotated data and code to facilitate further research.</p>
