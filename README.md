<h2>A Comparative Assessment of Technology Acceptance and Learning Outcomes in Computer-based versus VR-based Pedagogical Agents</h2>
<h3>Aimilios Hadjiliasi, Louis Nisiotis, Irene Polycarpou</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As educational technology evolves, the potential of Pedagogical Agents (PAs) in supporting education is extensively explored. Typically, research on PAs has primarily focused on computer-based learning environments, but their use in VR-based environments and integration into education is still in its infancy. To address this gap, this paper presents a mixed method comparative study that has been conducted to evaluate and examine how these computer-based PAs and VR-based PAs compare, towards their learning efficacy and technology acceptance. 92 Computing and Engineering undergraduate students were recruited and participated in an educational experience focusing on computing machinery education. The findings of this study revealed that both approaches can effectively facilitate learning acquisition, and both technologies have been positively perceived by participants toward acceptance, without any significant differences. The findings of this study shed light on the potential of utilizing intelligent PAs to support education, contributing towards the advancement of our understanding of how to integrate such technologies to develop learning interventions, and establishing the foundation for future investigations that aim to successfully integrate and use PAs in education.</p>

Abstract: The emergence of deep learning (DL) has provided great opportunities for the high-throughput analysis of atomic-resolution micrographs. However, the DL models trained by image patches in fixed size generally lack efficiency and flexibility when processing micrographs containing diversified atomic configurations. Herein, inspired by the similarity between the atomic structures and graphs, we describe a few-shot learning framework based on an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) to analyze a library of atomic structures (e.g., vacancies, phases, grain boundaries, doping, etc.), showing significantly promoted robustness and three orders of magnitude reduced computing parameters compared to the image-driven DL models, which is especially evident for those aggregated vacancy lines with flexible lattice distortion. Besides, the intuitiveness of graphs enables quantitative and straightforward extraction of the atomic-scale structural features in batches, thus statistically unveiling the self-assembly dynamics of vacancy lines under electron beam irradiation. A versatile model toolkit is established by integrating EGNN sub-models for single structure recognition to process images involving varied configurations in the form of a task chain, leading to the discovery of novel doping configurations with superior electrocatalytic properties for hydrogen evolution reactions. This work provides a powerful tool to explore structure diversity in a fast, accurate, and intelligent manner.</p>

<h2>Let Me Teach You: Pedagogical Foundations of Feedback for Language Models</h2>
<h3>Beatriz Borges, Niket Tandon, Tanja K\"aser, Antoine Bosselut</h3>
<p>arXiv:2307.00279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural Language Feedback (NLF) is an increasingly popular mechanism for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences. Despite the diversity of the information it can convey, NLF methods are often hand-designed and arbitrary, with little systematic grounding. At the same time, research in learning sciences has long established several effective feedback models. In this opinion piece, we compile ideas from pedagogy to introduce FELT, a feedback framework for LLMs that outlines various characteristics of the feedback space, and a feedback content taxonomy based on these variables, providing a general mapping of the feedback space. In addition to streamlining NLF designs, FELT also brings out new, unexplored directions for research in NLF. We make our taxonomy available to the community, providing guides and examples for mapping our categorizations to future research.</p>

<h2>Large-Scale Multiple Testing of Composite Null Hypotheses Under Heteroskedasticity</h2>
<h3>Bowen Gang, Trambak Banerjee</h3>
<p>arXiv:2306.07362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heteroskedasticity poses several methodological challenges in designing valid and powerful procedures for simultaneous testing of composite null hypotheses. In particular, the conventional practice of standardizing or re-scaling heteroskedastic test statistics in this setting may severely affect the power of the underlying multiple testing procedure. Additionally, when the inferential parameter of interest is correlated with the variance of the test statistic, methods that ignore this dependence may fail to control the type I error at the desired level. We propose a new Heteroskedasticity Adjusted Multiple Testing (HAMT) procedure that avoids data reduction by standardization, and directly incorporates the side information from the variances into the testing procedure. Our approach relies on an improved nonparametric empirical Bayes deconvolution estimator that offers a practical strategy for capturing the dependence between the inferential parameter of interest and the variance of the test statistic. We develop theory to show that HAMT is asymptotically valid and optimal for FDR control. Simulation results demonstrate that HAMT outperforms existing procedures with substantial power gain across many settings at the same FDR level. The method is illustrated on an application involving the detection of engaged users on a mobile game app.</p>
