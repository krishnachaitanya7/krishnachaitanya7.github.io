<h2>Impedance Trajectory Analysis during Power Swing for Grid-Forming Inverter with Different Current Limiters</h2>
<h3>Yanshu Niu, Zhe Yang, Bikash C. Pal</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) are capable of emulating the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through the careful design of the control loops. However, the current limiter in the control loops of the GFM IBR poses challenges to the effectiveness of power swing detection functions designed for SG-based systems. Among various current limiting strategies, current saturation algorithms (CSAs), widely employed for their strict current limiting capability, are the focus of this paper. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the conditions for entering and exiting the current saturation mode of the GFM IBR under three CSAs. Furthermore, the corresponding impedance trajectories observed by the distance relay on the GFM IBR side are investigated. The analysis results reveal that the unique impedance trajectories under these CSAs markedly differ from those associated with SGs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the conventional power swing detection scheme may lose functionality due to the rapid movement of the trajectory or its failure to pass through the detection zones. Conclusions are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.</p>

<h2>An iterative spectral algorithm for digraph clustering</h2>
<h3>James Martin, Tim Rogers, Luca Zanetti</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.17951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph clustering is a fundamental technique in data analysis with applications in many different fields. While there is a large body of work on clustering undirected graphs, the problem of clustering directed graphs is much less understood. The analysis is more complex in the directed graph case for two reasons: the clustering must preserve directional information in the relationships between clusters, and directed graphs have non-Hermitian adjacency matrices whose properties are less conducive to traditional spectral methods. Here we consider the problem of partitioning the vertex set of a directed graph into $k\ge 2$ clusters so that edges between different clusters tend to follow the same direction. We present an iterative algorithm based on spectral methods applied to new Hermitian representations of directed graphs. Our algorithm performs favourably against the state-of-the-art, both on synthetic and real-world data sets. Additionally, it is able to identify a "meta-graph" of $k$ vertices that represents the higher-order relations between clusters in a directed graph. We showcase this capability on data sets pertaining food webs, biological neural networks, and the online card game Hearthstone.</p>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can empower teachers to build pedagogical conversational agents (PCAs) customized for their students. As students have different prior knowledge and motivation levels, teachers must review the adaptivity of their PCAs to diverse students. Existing chatbot reviewing methods (e.g., direct chat and benchmarks) are either manually intensive for multiple iterations or limited to testing only single-turn interactions. We present TeachTune, where teachers can create simulated students and review PCAs by observing automated chats between PCAs and simulated students. Our technical pipeline instructs an LLM-based student to simulate prescribed knowledge levels and traits, helping teachers explore diverse conversation patterns. Our pipeline could produce simulated students whose behaviors correlate highly to their input knowledge and motivation levels within 5% and 10% accuracy gaps. Thirty science teachers designed PCAs in a between-subjects study, and using TeachTune resulted in a lower task load and higher student profile coverage over a baseline.</p>

Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.</p>
