<h2>Attention Mechanisms in Dynamical Systems: A Case Study with Predator-Prey Models</h2>
<h3>David Balaban</h3>
<p>arXiv:2505.06503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms are widely used in artificial intelligence to enhance performance and interpretability. In this paper, we investigate their utility in modeling classical dynamical systems -- specifically, a noisy predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) system. We train a simple linear attention model on perturbed time-series data to reconstruct system trajectories. Remarkably, the learned attention weights align with the geometric structure of the Lyapunov function: high attention corresponds to flat regions (where perturbations have small effect), and low attention aligns with steep regions (where perturbations have large effect). We further demonstrate that attention-based weighting can serve as a proxy for sensitivity analysis, capturing key phase-space properties without explicit knowledge of the system equations. These results suggest a novel use of AI-derived attention for interpretable, data-driven analysis and control of nonlinear systems. For example our framework could support future work in biological modeling of circadian rhythms, and interpretable machine learning for dynamical environments.</p>

<h2>Persistent Homology: A Pedagogical Introduction with Biological Applications</h2>
<h3>Aurelie Jodelle Kemme, Collins Amburo Agyingi</h3>
<p>arXiv:2505.06583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) is a fundamental tool in computational topology, designed to uncover the intrinsic geometric and topological features of data across multiple scales. Originating within the broader framework of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), PH has found diverse applications ranging from protein structure and knot analysis to financial domains such as Bitcoin behaviour and stock market dynamics. Despite its growing relevance, there remains a lack of accessible resources that bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical implementation for beginners. This paper offers a clear and comprehensive introduction to persistent homology, guiding readers from core concepts to real-world applications. Specifically, we illustrate the methodology through the analysis of a 3-1 supercoiled DNA structure. The paper is tailored for readers without prior exposure to algebraic topology, aiming to demystify persistent homology and foster its broader adoption in data analysis tasks.</p>

<h2>Quadrupedal Robot Skateboard Mounting via Reverse Curriculum Learning</h2>
<h3>Danil Belov, Artem Erkhov, Elizaveta Pestova, Ilya Osokin, Dzmitry Tsetserukou, Pavel Osinenko</h3>
<p>arXiv:2505.06561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to enable quadrupedal robots to mount skateboards using Reverse Curriculum Reinforcement Learning. Although prior work has demonstrated skateboarding for quadrupeds that are already positioned on the board, the initial mounting phase still poses a significant challenge. A goal-oriented methodology was adopted, beginning with the terminal phases of the task and progressively increasing the complexity of the problem definition to approximate the desired objective. The learning process was initiated with the skateboard rigidly fixed within the global coordinate frame and the robot positioned directly above it. Through gradual relaxation of these initial conditions, the learned policy demonstrated robustness to variations in skateboard position and orientation, ultimately exhibiting a successful transfer to scenarios involving a mobile skateboard. The code, trained models, and reproducible examples are available at the following link: https://github.com/dancher00/quadruped-skateboard-mounting</p>

<h2>Asymptotic limits of spiked eigenvalues and eigenvectors of signal-plus-noise matrices with weak signals and heteroskedastic noise</h2>
<h3>Xiaoyu Liu, Yiming Liu, Guangming Pan, Lingyue Zhang, Zhixiang Zhang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2310.13939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is to study a signal-plus-noise model in high dimensional settings when the dimension and the sample size are comparable. Specifically, we assume that the noise has a general covariance matrix that allows for heteroskedasticity, and that the deterministic signal has the same magnitude as the noise and can have a rank that tends to infinity. We develop the asymptotic limits of the left and right spiked singular vectors of the signal-plusnoise data matrix and the limits of the spiked eigenvalues of the corresponding Gram matrix. As an application, we propose a new criterion to estimate the number of clusters in clustering problems.</p>

<h3>Eason Chen, Chenyu Lin, Yu-Kai Huang, Xinyi Tang, Aprille Xi, Jionghao Lin, Kenneth Koedinger</h3>
<p>arXiv:2505.06676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedagogical Agents (PAs) show significant potential for boosting student engagement and learning outcomes by providing adaptive, on-demand support in educational contexts. However, existing PA solutions are often hampered by pre-scripted dialogue, unnatural animations, uncanny visual realism, and high development costs. To address these gaps, we introduce VTutor, an open-source SDK leveraging lightweight WebGL, Unity, and JavaScript frameworks. VTutor receives text outputs from a large language model (LLM), converts them into audio via text-to-speech, and then renders a real-time, lip-synced pedagogical agent (PA) for immediate, large-scale deployment on web-based learning platforms. By providing on-demand, personalized feedback, VTutor strengthens students' motivation and deepens their engagement with instructional material. Using an anime-like aesthetic, VTutor alleviates the uncanny valley effect, allowing learners to engage with expressive yet comfortably stylized characters. Our evaluation with 50 participants revealed that VTutor significantly outperforms the existing talking-head approaches (e.g., SadTalker) on perceived synchronization accuracy, naturalness, emotional expressiveness, and overall preference. As an open-source project, VTutor welcomes community-driven contributions - from novel character designs to specialized showcases of pedagogical agent applications - that fuel ongoing innovation in AI-enhanced education. By providing an accessible, customizable, and learner-centered PA solution, VTutor aims to elevate human-AI interaction experience in education fields, ultimately broadening the impact of AI in learning contexts.

<h2>FACET: Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking for Legged Robots</h2>
<h3>Botian Xu, Haoyang Weng, Qingzhou Lu, Yang Gao, Huazhe Xu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2505.06883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in legged robot control, enabling locomotion across diverse terrains and complex loco-manipulation capabilities. However, the commonly used position or velocity tracking-based objectives are agnostic to forces experienced by the robot, leading to stiff and potentially dangerous behaviors and poor control during forceful interactions. To address this limitation, we present \emph{Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking} (FACET). Inspired by impedance control, we use RL to train a control policy to imitate a virtual mass-spring-damper system, allowing fine-grained control under external forces by manipulating the virtual spring. In simulation, we demonstrate that our quadruped robot achieves improved robustness to large impulses (up to 200 Ns) and exhibits controllable compliance, achieving an 80% reduction in collision impulse. The policy is deployed to a physical robot to showcase both compliance and the ability to engage with large forces by kinesthetic control and pulling payloads up to 2/3 of its weight. Further extension to a legged loco-manipulator and a humanoid shows the applicability of our method to more complex settings to enable whole-body compliance control.

<h2>Towards Actionable Pedagogical Feedback: A Multi-Perspective Analysis of Mathematics Teaching and Tutoring Dialogue</h2>
<h3>Jannatun Naim, Jie Cao, Fareen Tasneem, Jennifer Jacobs, Brent Milne, James Martin, Tamara Sumner</h3>
<p>arXiv:2505.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with 43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments. Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles of both educators and students.</p>

<h2>ALPCAH: Subspace Learning for Sample-wise Heteroscedastic Data</h2>
<h3>Javier Salazar Cavazos, Jeffrey A. Fessler, Laura Balzano</h3>
<p>arXiv:2505.07272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data dimensionality reduction. However, some applications involve heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This paper develops a subspace learning method, named ALPCAH, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace basis associated with the low-rank structure of the data. Our method makes no distributional assumptions of the low-rank component and does not assume that the noise variances are known. Further, this method uses a soft rank constraint that does not require subspace dimension to be known. Additionally, this paper develops a matrix factorized version of ALPCAH, named LR-ALPCAH, that is much faster and more memory efficient at the cost of requiring subspace dimension to be known or estimated. Simulations and real data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing algorithms. Code available at https://github.com/javiersc1/ALPCAH.</p>

<h2>A Clinical Tuning Framework for Continuous Kinematic and Impedance Control of a Powered Knee-Ankle Prosthesis</h2>
<h3>Emma Reznick, T. Kevin Best, Robert Gregg</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.10154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Configuring a prosthetic leg is an integral part of the fitting process, but the personalization of a multi-modal powered knee-ankle prosthesis is often too complex to realize in a clinical environment. This paper develops both the technical means to individualize a hybrid kinematic-impedance controller for variable-incline walking and sit-stand transitions, and an intuitive Clinical Tuning Interface (CTI) that allows prosthetists to directly modify the controller behavior. Utilizing an established method for predicting kinematic gait individuality alongside a new parallel approach for kinetic individuality, we personalize continuous-phase/task models of joint impedance (during stance) and kinematics (during swing) using tuned characteristics exclusively from level-ground walking. To take advantage of this method, we developed a CTI that translates common clinical tuning parameters into model adjustments for the walking and sit-stand controllers. We then conducted a case study where a prosthetist iteratively tuned the powered prosthesis to an above-knee amputee participant in a simulated clinical session involving sit-stand transitions and level walking, from which incline/decline walking features were automatically calibrated. The prosthetist fully tuned the multi-activity prosthesis controller in under 20 min. Each iteration of tuning (i.e., observation, parameter adjustment, and model reprocessing) took 2 min on average for walking and 1 min on average for sit-stand. The tuned behavior changes were appropriately manifested in the commanded prosthesis torques, both at the manually tuned tasks and automatically tuned tasks (inclines). This paper introduces a clinical tuning interface that simplifies the tuning process for multimodal robotic prosthetic legs, reducing the time required from several hours to just 20 min thus improving clinical feasibility.</p>

<h2>Perceptive Mixed-Integer Footstep Control for Underactuated Bipedal Walking on Rough Terrain</h2>
<h3>Brian Acosta, Michael Posa</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.19391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traversing rough terrain requires dynamic bipeds to stabilize themselves through foot placement without stepping in unsafe areas. Planning these footsteps online is challenging given non-convexity of the safe terrain, and imperfect perception and state estimation. This paper addresses these challenges with a full-stack perception and control system for achieving underactuated walking on discontinuous terrain. First, we develop model-predictive footstep control (MPFC), a single mixed-integer quadratic program which assumes a convex polygon terrain decomposition to optimize over discrete foothold choice, footstep position, ankle torque, template dynamics, and footstep timing at over 100 Hz. We then propose a novel approach for generating convex polygon terrain decompositions online. Our perception stack decouples safe-terrain classification from fitting planar polygons, generating a temporally consistent terrain segmentation in real time using a single CPU thread. We demonstrate the performance of our perception and control stack through outdoor experiments with the underactuated biped Cassie, achieving state of the art perceptive bipedal walking on discontinuous terrain.
