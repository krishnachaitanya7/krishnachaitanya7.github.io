<h2>The Hiraga-Ichino-Ikeda conjecture on formal degrees for classical groups</h2>
<h3>Rapha\"el Beuzart-Plessis</h3>
<p>arXiv:2508.08470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Hiraga-Ichino-Ikeda relating formal degrees of square-integrable representations to adjoint gamma factors for symplectic and even orthogonal groups over characteristic zero non-Archimedean local fields. The proof is based on the twisted endoscopic characterization of the local Langlands correspondence for such groups and extends an approach already appearing in the original paper of Hiraga-Ichino-Ikeda itself inspired from earlier work of Shahidi. Namely, the argument consists in computing in two different ways a residue of certain standard intertwining operators suitably extended to a large representation realized on an explicit space of functions. This gives rise to the spectral decomposition of certain singular twisted orbital integrals. The main theorem follows from a comparison of this identity with the Plancherel formula of a symplectic or even orthogonal group. The proof can be adapted to deal with other classical groups, namely odd orthogonal and unitary groups, but the formal degree conjecture was already established in these cases.</p>

<h2>Efficient Function Approximation Under Heteroskedastic Noise</h2>
<h3>Yuji Nakatsukasa, Yifu Zhang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2508.08683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating a function $f(x)$ on $[-1,1]$ based on $N+1$ samples is a classical problem in numerical analysis. If the samples come with heteroskedastic noise depending on $x$ of variance $\sigma(x)^2$, an $O(N\log N)$ algorithm for this problem has not yet been found in the current literature. In this paper, we propose a method called HeteroChebtrunc, adapted from an algorithm named NoisyChebtrunc. Using techniques in high-dimensional probability, we show that with high probability, HeteroChebtrunc achieves a tighter infinity-norm error bound than NoisyChebtrunc under heteroskedastic noise. This algorithm runs in $O(N+\hat{N}\log \hat{N})$ operations, where $\hat{N}\ll N$ is a chosen parameter. While investigating the properties of HeteroChebtrunc, we also derive a high-probability non-asymptotic relative error bound on the sample variance estimator for subgaussian variables, which is potentially another result of broader interest. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the improved uniform error of our algorithm.</p>

<h2>Redactable Blockchains: An Overview</h2>
<h3>Federico Calandra, Marco Bernardo, Andrea Esposito, Francesco Fabris</h3>
<p>arXiv:2508.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchains are widely recognized for their immutability, which provides robust guarantees of data integrity and transparency. However, this same feature poses significant challenges in real-world situations that require regulatory compliance, correction of erroneous data, or removal of sensitive information. Redactable blockchains address the limitations of traditional ones by enabling controlled, auditable modifications to blockchain data, primarily through cryptographic mechanisms such as chameleon hash functions and alternative redaction schemes. This report examines the motivations for introducing redactability, surveys the cryptographic primitives that enable secure edits, and analyzes competing approaches and their shortcomings. Special attention is paid to the practical deployment of redactable blockchains in private settings, with discussions of use cases in healthcare, finance, Internet of drones, and federated learning. Finally, the report outlines further challenges, also in connection with reversible computing, and the future potential of redactable blockchains in building law-compliant, trustworthy, and scalable digital infrastructures.</p>

<p>arXiv:2503.17533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel 3D graphical representation for impedance control, called the impedance space, to foster the analysis of the dynamic behavior of robotic compliant controllers. The method overcomes limitations of existing 2D graphical approaches by incorporating mass, stiffness, and damping dynamics, and associates the impedance control parameters with linear transformations to plot a parametric 3D ellipse and its projections in 2D for a mass-spring-damper impedance under sinusoidal reference. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed representation for analysis of impedance control. The method applies to various compliant control topologies and can be extended to other model-based control approaches.</p>

<h2>AI Pedagogy: Dialogic Social Learning for Artificial Agents</h2>
<h3>Sabrina Patania, Luca Annese, Cansu Koyuturk, Azzurra Ruggeri, Dimitri Ognibene</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.21065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals, limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering</p>
