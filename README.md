<p>arXiv:2502.05817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quadrupedal robots have demonstrated impressive agility and the ability to traverse diverse terrains. However, hardware issues, such as motor overheating or joint locking, may occur during long-distance walking or traversing through rough terrains leading to locomotion failures. Although several studies have proposed fault-tolerant control methods for quadrupedal robots, there are still challenges in traversing unstructured terrains. In this paper, we propose DreamFLEX, a robust fault-tolerant locomotion controller that enables a quadrupedal robot to traverse complex environments even under joint failure conditions. DreamFLEX integrates an explicit failure estimation and modulation network that jointly estimates the robot's joint fault vector and utilizes this information to adapt the locomotion pattern to faulty conditions in real-time, enabling quadrupedal robots to maintain stability and performance in rough terrains. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamFLEX outperforms existing methods in both simulation and real-world scenarios, effectively managing hardware failures while maintaining robust locomotion performance.</p>

Abstract: High-impedance arc faults in AC power systems have the potential to lead to catastrophic accidents. However, significant challenges exist in identifying these faults because of the much weaker characteristics and variety when grounded with different surfaces. Addressing a noteworthy gap in prior research, which largely focused on arc fault detection in low-voltage systems.
  A novel approach has been applied that offers rapid arc fault detection for medium voltage distribution lines. In contrast to existing black-box feature-based approaches, Hankel alternative view of the Koopman (HAVOK) analysis developed from nonlinear dynamics has been applied which offers not only interpretable features but also opens up new application options in the area of arc fault detection. The method displays a much faster detection speed within 0.45 ms making it appropriate for real-time applications. It demonstrates the ability to detect arc faults across various scenarios, boosting its practical importance for stakeholders in safety-critical industries.</p>

<h2>HetSwarm: Cooperative Navigation of Heterogeneous Swarm in Dynamic and Dense Environments through Impedance-based Guidance</h2>

<p>arXiv:2502.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for efficient logistics and warehouse management, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as a valuable complement to automated guided vehicles (AGVs). UAVs enhance efficiency by navigating dense environments and operating at varying altitudes. However, their limited flight time, battery life, and payload capacity necessitate a supporting ground station. To address these challenges, we propose HetSwarm, a heterogeneous multi-robot system that combines a UAV and a mobile ground robot for collaborative navigation in cluttered and dynamic conditions. Our approach employs an artificial potential field (APF)-based path planner for the UAV, allowing it to dynamically adjust its trajectory in real time. The ground robot follows this path while maintaining connectivity through impedance links, ensuring stable coordination. Additionally, the ground robot establishes temporal impedance links with low-height ground obstacles to avoid local collisions, as these obstacles do not interfere with the UAV's flight. Experimental validation of HetSwarm in diverse environmental conditions demonstrated a 90% success rate across 30 test cases. The ground robot exhibited an average deviation of 45 cm near obstacles, confirming effective collision avoidance. Extensive simulations in the Gym PyBullet environment further validated the robustness of our system for real-world applications, demonstrating its potential for dynamic, real-time task execution in cluttered environments.</p>

<h2>Unifying AI Tutor Evaluation: An Evaluation Taxonomy for Pedagogical Ability Assessment of LLM-Powered AI Tutors</h2>
<h3>Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Kseniia Petukhova, Ekaterina Kochmar</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.09416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are effective as AI tutors and whether they demonstrate pedagogical abilities necessary for good AI tutoring in educational dialogues. Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusions in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench - a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 and Llama-3.1-8B LLMs as evaluators and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI tutors' development.</p>

<h2>On the order statistics from the XLindley distribution and associated inference with an application to fatigue data</h2>
<h3>Zuber Akhter, S. M. T. K. MirMostafaee, Abu Bakar, Ehsan Ormoz</h3>
<p>arXiv:2502.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the order statistics from a newly-introduced lifetime distribution called the XLindley distribution. We have derived explicit closed form expressions for the single moments and product moments of order statistics from the XLindley distribution. Utilizing these expressions, we calculated the means, variances, and covariances of order statistics for sample sizes ranging from n = 1 to n = 10 and arbitrarily selected parameter values. Additionally, these moments allow us to identify the best linear unbiased estimators and best linear invariant estimators for the location and scale parameters based on both complete samples and Type-II right censored samples. We also address the linear prediction of unobserved order statistics based on Type-II right-censored samples. We also explore the formulation of confidence intervals for location and scale parameters, along with prediction intervals for unobserved order statistics. To provide comparison and illustration, we conduct a simulation study and analyze a real data example. Finally, we conclude with several remarks.</p>
