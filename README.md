<h2>Assessing Pedagogical Readiness for Digital Innovation: A Mixed-Methods Study</h2>
<h3>Ning Yulin, Solomon Danquah Danso</h3>
<p>arXiv:2502.15781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital innovation in education has revolutionized teaching and learning processes, demanding a rethink of pedagogical competence among educators. This study evaluates the preparation of instructors to use digital technologies into their educational practices. The study used a mixed-methods approach, integrating both qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys to evaluate teachers' institutional support systems, beliefs, and technical proficiency. The results show that even while a large number of educators acknowledge the benefits of digital tools, problems including poor professional development and change aversion still exist. In order to improve digital pedagogical preparation, the study emphasizes the necessity of focused training initiatives and encouraging institutional regulations. There is discussion on the implications for educational institutions and policymakers.</p>

Abstract: Training and deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies for robots, especially in accomplishing specific tasks, presents substantial challenges. Recent advancements have explored diverse reward function designs, training techniques, simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfers, and performance analysis methodologies, yet these still require significant human intervention. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for training and deploying RL policies, guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), and evaluates its effectiveness on bipedal robots. The framework consists of three interconnected modules: an LLM-guided reward function design module, an RL training module leveraging prior work, and a sim-to-real homomorphic evaluation module. This design significantly reduces the need for human input by utilizing only essential simulation and deployment platforms, with the option to incorporate human-engineered strategies and historical data. We detail the construction of these modules, their advantages over traditional approaches, and demonstrate the framework's capability to autonomously develop and refine controlling strategies for bipedal robot locomotion, showcasing its potential to operate independently of human intervention.</p>

<h2>Bootstrap-based Inference for Bivariate Heteroscedastic Extremes with a Changing Tail Copula</h2>
<h3>Yifan Hu, Yanxi Hou</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.15819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a copula-based model for independent but non-identically distributed data with heteroscedastic extremes marginal and changing tail dependence structures. We establish a unified framework for inference by proving the weak convergence of the bivariate sequential tail empirical process and its empirical bootstrap counterpart. We derive the asymptotic properties of several estimators on the tail, including the quasi-tail copula, integrated scedasis function, and Hill estimator, treating them as functionals of the bivariate sequential tail empirical process. This process-centric approach enables the development of bootstrap-based methods and ensures the theoretical validity of the derived statistics. As an application of our inference method, we propose bootstrap-based tests for the equivalence of extreme value indices, the equivalence of scedasis functions, and non-changing tail dependence when marginal scedasis functions are identical. Our simulations validate the robustness and efficiency of the bootstrap-based tests.</p>
