<h2>Discrete-Time Optimal Control of Species Augmentation for Predator-Prey Model</h2>
<h3>Munkaila Dasumani, Suzanne Lenhart, Gladys K. Onyambu, Stephen E. Moore</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.13394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Species augmentation is one of the methods used to promote biodiversity and prevent endangered species loss and extinction. The current work applies discrete-time optimal control theory to two models of species augmentation for predator-prey relationships. In discrete-time models, the order in which events occur can give different qualitative results. Two models representing different orders of events of optimal augmentation timing are considered. In one model, the population grows and predator-prey action occurs before the translocation of reserve species for augmentation. In the second model, the augmentation happens first and is followed by growth and then predator-prey action.
  The reserve and target populations are subjected to strong Allee effects. The optimal augmentation models employed in this work aim to maximize the prey (target population) and reserve population at the final time and minimize the associated cost at each time step. Numerical simulations in the two models are conducted using the discrete version of the forward-backward sweep method and the sequential quadratic programming iterative method, respectively. The simulation results show different population levels in the two models under varying parameter scenarios. Objective functional values showing percentage increases with optimal controls are calculated for each simulation. Different optimal augmentation strategies for the two orders of events are discussed. This work represents the first optimal augmentation results for models incorporating the predator-prey relationship with discrete events.</p>

<h2>Local electrical impedance tomography via projections</h2>

<p>arXiv:2601.14198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for approximately eliminating the effect that conductivity changes outside the region of interest have in electrical impedance tomography, allowing to form a local reconstruction in the region of interest only. The method considers the Jacobian matrix of the forward map, i.e., of the map that sends the discretized conductivity to the electrode measurements, at an initial guess for the conductivity. The Jacobian matrix is divided columnwise into two parts: one corresponding to the region of interest and a nuisance Jacobian corresponding to the rest of the domain. The leading idea is to project both the electrode measurements and the forward map onto the orthogonal complement of the span of a number of left-hand singular vectors for a suitably weighted nuisance Jacobian. The weighting can, e.g., account for the element sizes in a finite element discretization or to prior information on the conductivity outside the region of interest. The inverse problem is then solved by considering the projected relation between the measurements and the forward map, only reconstructing the conductivity in the region of interest. The functionality of the method is demonstrated by applying a reconstruction algorithm that combines lagged diffusivity iteration and total variation regularization to experimental data. In particular, data from a head-shaped water tank is considered, with the conductivity change in the region of interest mimicking growth of a hemorrhagic stroke and the changes outside the region of interest imitating physiological variations in the conductivity of the scalp.</p>

<h2>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of a trait-structured predator-prey model</h2>
<h3>Manh Hong Duong, Fabian Spill, Blaine van Rensburg</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.07379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling between evolutionary and ecological changes (eco-evolutionary dynamics) has been shown to be relevant among diverse species, and is also of interest outside of ecology, i.e. in cancer evolution. These dynamics play an important role in determining survival in response to climate change, motivating the need for mathematical models to capture this often complex interplay. Models incorporating eco-evolutionary dynamics often sacrifice analytical tractability to capture the complexity of real systems, do not explicitly consider the effect of population heterogeneity, or focus on long-term behaviour. In order to capture population heterogeneity, both transient, and long-term dynamics, while retaining tractability, we generalise a moment-based method applicable in the regime of small segregational variance to the case of time-dependent mortality and birth. These results are applied to a predator-prey model, where ecological parameters such as the contact rate between species are trait-structured. The trait-distribution of the prey species is shown to be approximately Gaussian with constant variance centered on the mean trait, which is asymptotically governed by an autonomous ODE. In this way, we make explicit the impact of eco-evolutionary dynamics on the transient behaviour and long-term fate of the prey species.</p>

<h2>The Cost of Convenience: Identifying, Analyzing, and Mitigating Predatory Loan Applications on Android</h2>
<h3>Olawale Amos Akanji, Manuel Egele, Gianluca Stringhini</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital lending applications, commonly referred to as loan apps, have become a primary channel for microcredit in emerging markets. However, many of these apps demand excessive permissions and misuse sensitive user data for coercive debt-recovery practices, including harassment, blackmail, and public shaming that affect both borrowers and their contacts.
  This paper presents the first cross-country measurement of loan app compliance against both national regulations and Google's Financial Services Policy. We analyze 434 apps drawn from official registries and app markets from Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Philippines. To operationalize policy requirements at scale, we translate policy text into testable permission checks using LLM-assisted policy-to-permission mapping and combine this with static and dynamic analyses of loan apps' code and runtime behavior.
  Our findings reveal pervasive non-compliance among approved apps: 141 violate national regulatory policy and 147 violate Google policy. Dynamic analysis further shows that several apps transmit sensitive data (contacts, SMS, location, media) before user signup or registration, undermining informed consent and enabling downstream harassment of borrowers and third parties. Following our disclosures, Google removed 93 flagged apps from Google Play, representing over 300M cumulative installs.
  We advocate for adopting our methodology as a proactive compliance-monitoring tool and offer targeted recommendations for regulators, platforms, and developers to strengthen privacy protections. Overall, our results highlight the need for coordinated enforcement and robust technical safeguards to ensure that digital lending supports financial inclusion without compromising user privacy or safety.</p>

<p>arXiv:2601.13876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Science demonstrations are important for effective STEM education, yet teachers face challenges in conducting them safely and consistently across multiple occasions, where robotics can be helpful. However, current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models require substantial computational resources and sacrifice language generation capabilities to maximize efficiency, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained educational settings that require interpretable, explanation-generating systems. We present \textit{Pedagogical VLA Framework}, a framework that applies pedagogical alignment to lightweight VLA models through four components: text healing to restore language generation capabilities, large language model (LLM) distillation to transfer pedagogical knowledge, safety training for educational environments, and pedagogical evaluation adjusted to science education contexts. We evaluate Pedagogical VLA Framework across five science demonstrations spanning physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science, using an evaluation framework developed in collaboration with science education experts. Our evaluation assesses both task performance (success rate, protocol compliance, efficiency, safety) and pedagogical quality through teacher surveys and LLM-as-Judge assessment. We additionally provide qualitative analysis of generated texts. Experimental results demonstrate that Pedagogical VLA Framework achieves comparable task performance to baseline models while producing contextually appropriate educational explanations.</p>

<h2>EmoBipedNav: Emotion-aware Social Navigation for Bipedal Robots with Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<h3>Wei Zhu, Abirath Raju, Abdulaziz Shamsah, Anqi Wu, Seth Hutchinson, Ye Zhao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.12538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents an emotion-aware navigation framework -- EmoBipedNav -- using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for bipedal robots walking in socially interactive environments. The inherent locomotion constraints of bipedal robots challenge their safe maneuvering capabilities in dynamic environments. When combined with the intricacies of social environments, including pedestrian interactions and social cues, such as emotions, these challenges become even more pronounced. To address these coupled problems, we propose a two-stage pipeline that considers both bipedal locomotion constraints and complex social environments. Specifically, social navigation scenarios are represented using sequential LiDAR grid maps (LGMs), from which we extract latent features, including collision regions, emotion-related discomfort zones, social interactions, and the spatio-temporal dynamics of evolving environments. The extracted features are directly mapped to the actions of reduced-order models (ROMs) through a DRL architecture. Furthermore, the proposed framework incorporates full-order dynamics and locomotion constraints during training, effectively accounting for tracking errors and restrictions of the locomotion controller while planning the trajectory with ROMs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach exceeds both model-based planners and DRL-based baselines. The hardware videos and open-source code are available at https://gatech-lidar.github.io/emobipednav.github.io/.</p>

<p>arXiv:2512.04475v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning on graphs has recently achieved impressive progress in various domains, including molecular property prediction and chip design. However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance.

<h2>ALPCAHUS: Subspace Clustering for Heteroscedastic Data</h2>
<h3>Javier Salazar Cavazos, Jeffrey A Fessler, Laura Balzano</h3>
<p>arXiv:2505.18918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data dimensionality reduction. Various methods have been proposed to extend PCA to the union of subspace (UoS) setting for clustering data that comes from multiple subspaces like K-Subspaces (KSS). However, some applications involve heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This paper develops a heteroscedastic-based subspace clustering method, named ALPCAHUS, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace bases associated with the low-rank structure of the data. This clustering algorithm builds on K-Subspaces (KSS) principles by extending the recently proposed heteroscedastic PCA method, named LR-ALPCAH, for clusters with heteroscedastic noise in the UoS setting. Simulations and real-data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing clustering algorithms.

<h2>The Collapse of Multilayer Predation and the Emergence of a Monolithic Leviathan</h2>
<h3>Li Tuobang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.13544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper constructs a multilayer recursive game model to demonstrate that in a rule vacuum environment, hierarchical predatory structures inevitably collapse into a monolithic political strongman system due to the conflict between exponentially growing rent dissipation and the rigidity of bottom-level survival constraints. We propose that the rise of a monolithic political strongman is essentially an "algorithmic entropy reduction" achieved through forceful means by the system to counteract the "informational entropy increase" generated by multilayer agency. However, the order gained at the expense of social complexity results in the stagnation of social evolutionary functions.</p>
