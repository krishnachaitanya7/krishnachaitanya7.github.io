<h2>Revisiting $(\infty,2)$-naturality of the Yoneda embedding</h2>
<h3>Tobias Lenz</h3>
<p>arXiv:2508.11526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Yoneda embedding 'is' $(\infty,2)$-natural with respect to the functoriality of presheaves via left Kan extension, refining the $(\infty,1)$-categorical result proven independently by Haugseng-Hebestreit-Linskens-Nuiten and Ramzi, and answering a question of Ben-Moshe.
  As the key technical ingredient, we show that the identity functor of the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-categories admits only one enhancement to an $(\infty,2)$-functor (namely, the identity functor).</p>

<h2>From NLG Evaluation to Modern Student Assessment in the Era of ChatGPT: The Great Misalignment Problem and Pedagogical Multi-Factor Assessment (P-MFA)</h2>
<h3>Mika H\"am\"al\"ainen, Kimmo Leivisk\"a</h3>
<p>arXiv:2512.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the growing epistemic parallel between NLG evaluation and grading of students in a Finnish University. We argue that both domains are experiencing a Great Misalignment Problem. As students increasingly use tools like ChatGPT to produce sophisticated outputs, traditional assessment methods that focus on final products rather than learning processes have lost their validity. To address this, we introduce the Pedagogical Multi-Factor Assessment (P-MFA) model, a process-based, multi-evidence framework inspired by the logic of multi-factor authentication.</p>
