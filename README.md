<h2>Beyond Diagonal Noise: A Better Predator-Prey Modeling Framework with Cross-Covariance</h2>
<h3>Jiguang Yu, Louis Shuo Wang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.22489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of stochasticity into continuous ecological models frequently relies on phenomenological, diagonal diffusion terms that lack a rigorous microscopic basis. We demonstrate that this standard practice fundamentally misrepresents the geometry of demographic fluctuations. By deriving a stochastic Rosenzweig--MacArthur model directly from an integer-valued, Bernoulli-coupled continuous-time Markov chain, we isolate the exact diffusion covariance structure dictated by event stoichiometry. We mathematically prove that coupled predation--conversion events inherently generate a structurally negative predator--prey cross-covariance, exposing the severe mathematical and biological limitations of standard diagonal-noise approximations. Furthermore, we resolve a persistent ambiguity in stochastic population modeling by explicitly formalizing the bifurcation between open-domain formulations (for survival-conditioned interior dynamics) and absorbed formulations (for extinction-permitting dynamics). To rigorously support this distinction, we develop a tailored two-stage Lyapunov well-posedness architecture that separates non-explosion criteria from boundary-barrier positivity invariance. By bridging microscopic event stoichiometry with macroscopic boundary-degenerate diffusions, this work replaces ad hoc noise constructs with a definitive, mathematically exact template for covariance-consistent and boundary-aware ecological modeling.</p>

Abstract: Using advanced machine learning techniques, we developed a method for reconstructing precisely the arrival direction and energy of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from the voltage traces they induced on ground-based radio detector arrays.
  In our approach, triggered antennas are represented as a graph structure, which serves as input for a graph neural network (GNN). By incorporating physical knowledge into both the GNN architecture and the input data, we improve the precision and reduce the required size of the training set with respect to a fully data-driven approach. This method achieves an angular resolution of 0.092{\deg} and an electromagnetic energy reconstruction resolution of 16.4% on simulated data with realistic noise conditions.
  We also employ uncertainty estimation methods to enhance the reliability of our predictions, quantifying the confidence of the GNN's outputs and providing confidence intervals for both direction and energy reconstruction. Finally, we investigate strategies to verify the model's consistency and robustness under real life variations, with the goal of identifying scenarios in which predictions remain reliable despite domain shifts between simulation and reality.</p>

<h2>DreamWaQ++: Obstacle-Aware Quadrupedal Locomotion With Resilient Multi-Modal Reinforcement Learning</h2>

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots hold promising potential for applications in navigating cluttered environments with resilience akin to their animal counterparts. However, their floating base configuration makes them vulnerable to real-world uncertainties, yielding substantial challenges in their locomotion control. Deep reinforcement learning has become one of the plausible alternatives for realizing a robust locomotion controller. However, the approaches that rely solely on proprioception sacrifice collision-free locomotion because they require front-feet contact to detect the presence of stairs to adapt the locomotion gait. Meanwhile, incorporating exteroception necessitates a precisely modeled map observed by exteroceptive sensors over a period of time. Therefore, this work proposes a novel method to fuse proprioception and exteroception featuring a resilient multi-modal reinforcement learning. The proposed method yields a controller that showcases agile locomotion performance on a quadrupedal robot over a myriad of real-world courses, including rough terrains, steep slopes, and high-rise stairs, while retaining its robustness against out-of-distribution situations.</p>

<h2>Learning Credal Ensembles via Distributionally Robust Optimization</h2>

<p>arXiv:2602.08470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Credal predictors are models that are aware of epistemic uncertainty and produce a convex set of probabilistic predictions. They offer a principled way to quantify predictive epistemic uncertainty (EU) and have been shown to improve model robustness in various settings. However, most state-of-the-art methods mainly define EU as disagreement caused by random training initializations, which mostly reflects sensitivity to optimization randomness rather than uncertainty from deeper sources. To address this, we define EU as disagreement among models trained with varying relaxations of the i.i.d. assumption between training and test data. Based on this idea, we propose CreDRO, which learns an ensemble of plausible models through distributionally robust optimization. As a result, CreDRO captures EU not only from training randomness but also from meaningful disagreement due to potential distribution shifts between training and test data. Empirical results show that CreDRO consistently outperforms existing credal methods on tasks such as out-of-distribution detection across multiple benchmarks and selective classification in medical applications.</p>
