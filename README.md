Abstract: Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data.
  Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text, extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage residual risks.
  This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty quantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical challenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical, and trustworthy release of imaging data for research.</p>
