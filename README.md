Abstract: While single-agent legged locomotion has witnessed remarkable progress, individual robots remain fundamentally constrained by physical actuation limits. To transcend these boundaries, we introduce Co-jump, a cooperative task where two quadrupedal robots synchronize to execute jumps far beyond their solo capabilities. We tackle the high-impulse contact dynamics of this task under a decentralized setting, achieving synchronization without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives. Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance. Notably, this precise coordination is achieved solely through proprioceptive feedback, establishing a foundation for communication-free collaborative locomotion in constrained environments.</p>

Abstract: Cyclists often encounter safety-critical situations in urban traffic, highlighting the need for assistive systems that support safe and informed decision-making. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.</p>

<h2>A Jointly Efficient and Optimal Algorithm for Heteroskedastic Generalized Linear Bandits with Adversarial Corruptions</h2>
<h3>Sanghwa Kim, Junghyun Lee, Se-Young Yun</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.10971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of heteroskedastic generalized linear bandits (GLBs) with adversarial corruptions, which subsumes various stochastic contextual bandit settings, including heteroskedastic linear bandits and logistic/Poisson bandits. We propose HCW-GLB-OMD, which consists of two components: an online mirror descent (OMD)-based estimator and Hessian-based confidence weights to achieve corruption robustness. This is computationally efficient in that it only requires ${O}(1)$ space and time complexity per iteration. Under the self-concordance assumption on the link function, we show a regret bound of $\tilde{{O}}\left( d \sqrt{\sum_t g(\tau_t) \dot{\mu}_{t,\star}} + d^2 g_{\max} \kappa + d \kappa C \right)$, where $\dot{\mu}_{t,\star}$ is the slope of $\mu$ around the optimal arm at time $t$, $g(\tau_t)$'s are potentially exogenously time-varying dispersions (e.g., $g(\tau_t) = \sigma_t^2$ for heteroskedastic linear bandits, $g(\tau_t) = 1$ for Bernoulli and Poisson), $g_{\max} = \max_{t \in [T]} g(\tau_t)$ is the maximum dispersion, and $C \geq 0$ is the total corruption budget of the adversary. We complement this with a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(d \sqrt{\sum_t g(\tau_t) \dot{\mu}_{t,\star}} + d C)$, unifying previous problem-specific lower bounds. Thus, our algorithm achieves, up to a $\kappa$-factor in the corruption term, instance-wise minimax optimality simultaneously across various instances of heteroskedastic GLBs with adversarial corruptions.</p>

<h2>Multi-Momentum Observer Contact Estimation for Bipedal Robots</h2>
<h3>J. Joe Payne, Daniel A. Hagen, Denis Garagi\'c, Aaron M. Johnson</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.03462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As bipedal robots become more and more popular in commercial and industrial settings, the ability to control them with a high degree of reliability is critical. To that end, this paper considers how to accurately estimate which feet are currently in contact with the ground so as to avoid improper control actions that could jeopardize the stability of the robot. Additionally, modern algorithms for estimating the position and orientation of a robot's base frame rely heavily on such contact mode estimates. Dedicated contact sensors on the feet can be used to estimate this contact mode, but these sensors are prone to noise, time delays, damage/yielding from repeated impacts with the ground, and are not available on every robot. To overcome these limitations, we propose a momentum observer based method for contact mode estimation that does not rely on such contact sensors. Often, momentum observers assume that the robot's base frame can be treated as an inertial frame. However, since many humanoids' legs represent a significant portion of the overall mass, the proposed method instead utilizes multiple simultaneous dynamic models. Each of these models assumes a different contact condition. A given contact assumption is then used to constrain the full dynamics in order to avoid assuming that either the body is an inertial frame or that a fully accurate estimate of body velocity is known. The (dis)agreement between each model's estimates and measurements is used to determine which contact mode is most likely using a Markov-style fusion method. The proposed method produces contact detection accuracy of up to 98.44% with a low noise simulation and 77.12% when utilizing data collect on the Sarcos Guardian XO robot (a hybrid humanoid/exoskeleton).</p>
