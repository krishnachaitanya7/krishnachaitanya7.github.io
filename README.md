Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology for next-generation wireless communications, offering energy-efficient control of electromagnetic (EM) waves. While conventional RIS models based on phase shifts and amplitude adjustments have been widely studied, they overlook complex EM phenomena such as mutual coupling, which are crucial for advanced wave manipulations. Recent efforts in EM-consistent modelling have provided more accurate representations of RIS behavior, highlighting challenges like structural scattering-an unwanted signal reflection that can lead to interference. In this paper, we analyze the impact of structural scattering in RIS architectures and compare traditional and EM-consistent models through full-wave simulations, thus providing practical insights on the realistic performance of current RIS designs. Our findings reveal the limitations of current modelling approaches in mitigating this issue, underscoring the need for new optimization strategies.</p>

Abstract: With the growing demand for efficient logistics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being paired with automated guided vehicles (AGVs). While UAVs offer the ability to navigate through dense environments and varying altitudes, they are limited by battery life, payload capacity, and flight duration, necessitating coordinated ground support.
  Focusing on heterogeneous navigation, SwarmVLM addresses these limitations by enabling semantic collaboration between UAVs and ground robots through impedance control. The system leverages the Vision Language Model (VLM) and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to adjust impedance control parameters in response to environmental changes. In this framework, the UAV acts as a leader using Artificial Potential Field (APF) planning for real-time navigation, while the ground robot follows via virtual impedance links with adaptive link topology to avoid collisions with short obstacles.
  The system demonstrated a 92% success rate across 12 real-world trials. Under optimal lighting conditions, the VLM-RAG framework achieved 8% accuracy in object detection and selection of impedance parameters. The mobile robot prioritized short obstacle avoidance, occasionally resulting in a lateral deviation of up to 50 cm from the UAV path, which showcases safe navigation in a cluttered setting.</p>

<h2>Koopman Operator Based Time-Delay Embeddings and State History Augmented LQR for Periodic Hybrid Systems: Bouncing Pendulum and Bipedal Walking</h2>
<h3>Chun-Ming Yang, Pranav A. Bhounsule</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.14455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-delay embedding is a technique that uses snapshots of state history over time to build a linear state space model of a nonlinear smooth system. We demonstrate that periodic non-smooth or hybrid system can also be modeled as a linear state space system using this approach as long as its behavior is consistent in modes and timings. We extend time-delay embeddings to generate a linear model of two periodic hybrid systems: the bouncing pendulum and the simplest walker with control inputs. This leads to a state history augmented linear quadratic regulator (LQR) which uses current and past state history for feedback control.
