<h2>Synthetic Media in Multilingual MOOCs: Deepfake Tutors, Pedagogical Effects, and Ethical-Policy Challenges</h2>
<h3>Alexandros Gazis, Erietta Chamalidou, Nikolaos Ntaoulas, Theodoros Vavouras</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, synthetic media from deepfake videos have emerged as a new interesting technology, whether that refers to cloned voices, multilingual translation models, or more recent applications of avatar tutors into higher education. As such, these technologies are rapidly becoming part of the multilingual distance learning model and, more recently, MOOCs worldwide. This article is a scoping review that focuses on recent international literature published between 2020 and 2025 to explore the usage of deepfake and synthetic media tools and methods in multilingual MOOC content and assess the influence of these technologies on social presence and participation. Similarly, we focus on ethical and political issues that are closely connected with the adaptation of these technologies, and upon analysing educational technology and policy documents, such as UNESCO's Guidelines and the EU AI Act, we pinpoint that the use of synthetic avatars and AI-generated videos can diminish production costs and assist multilingual learning. Evidently, concerns arise regarding authenticity, privacy, and the shifting nature of the teacher-learner relationship that are thoroughly discussed. As a result, the technical merit of this paper is the proposal of a policy framework that, in an effort to address these issues, focuses on transparency, responsible governance, and AI literacy. The goal is not to replace human instruction but to integrate synthetic media in ways that strengthen pedagogical design, safeguard rights, and ensure that multilingual MOOCs become more interesting and inclusive rather than more automated robotic processes and unequal</p>

<h2>Can Multimodal LLMs See Science Instruction? Benchmarking Pedagogical Reasoning in K-12 Classroom Videos</h2>
<h3>Yixuan Shen, Peng He, Honglu Liu, Yuyang Ji, Tingting Li, Tianlong Chen, Kaidi Xu, Feng Liu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K-12 science classrooms are rich sites of inquiry where students coordinate phenomena, evidence, and explanatory models through discourse; yet, the multimodal complexity of these interactions has made automated analysis elusive. Existing benchmarks for classroom discourse focus primarily on mathematics and rely solely on transcripts, overlooking the visual artifacts and model-based reasoning emphasized by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). We address this gap with SciIBI, the first video benchmark for analyzing science classroom discourse, featuring 113 NGSS-aligned clips annotated with Core Instructional Practices (CIP) and sophistication levels. By evaluating eight state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs, we reveal fundamental limitations: current models struggle to distinguish pedagogically similar practices, suggesting that CIP coding requires instructional reasoning beyond surface pattern matching. Furthermore, adding video input yields inconsistent gains across architectures. Crucially, our evidence-based evaluation reveals that models often succeed through surface shortcuts rather than genuine pedagogical understanding. These findings establish science classroom discourse as a challenging frontier for multimodal AI and point toward human-AI collaboration, where models retrieve evidence to accelerate expert review rather than replace it.</p>

<h2>Soft Surfaced Vision-Based Tactile Sensing for Bipedal Robot Applications</h2>
<h3>Jaeeun Kim, Junhee Lim, Yu She</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.18638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legged locomotion benefits from embodied sensing, where perception emerges from the physical interaction between body and environment. We present a soft-surfaced, vision-based tactile foot sensor that endows a bipedal robot with a skin-like deformable layer that captures contact deformations optically, turning foot-ground interactions into rich haptic signals. From a contact image stream, our method estimates contact pose (position and orientation), visualizes shear, computes center of pressure (CoP), classifies terrain, and detects geometric features of the contact patch. We validate these capabilities on a tilting platform and in visually obscured conditions, showing that foot-borne tactile feedback improves balance control and terrain awareness beyond proprioception alone. These findings suggest that integrating tactile perception into legged robot feet improves stability, adaptability, and environmental awareness, offering a promising direction toward more compliant and intelligent locomotion systems.

<h2>Co-Optimization of Network Topology and Variable Impedance Devices under Dynamic Line Ratings in Power Transmission Systems</h2>
<h3>Junseon Park, Hyeongon Park, Rahul K. Gupta</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.19587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system operators are increasingly deploying Grid Enhancing Technologies (GETs) to mitigate operational challenges such as line and transformer congestion, and voltage violations. These technologies, including Network Topology Optimization (NTO), Variable Impedance Devices (VIDs), and Dynamic Line Rating (DLR), enhance system flexibility and enable better utilization of existing network assets. However, as the deployment of multiple GETs grows, effective coordination among them becomes essential to fully realize their potential benefits. This paper presents a co-optimization framework that models and coordinates NTO, VID, and DLR within a unified optimization scheme to alleviate network congestion and minimize operational costs. The NTO formulation is developed using a node-breaker model, offering finer switching granularity and improved operational flexibility. The inclusion of VIDs introduces nonlinear and non-convex relationships in the optimization problem. DLR takes into account of weather conditions, primarily wind speed and ambient temperature, enabling adaptive utilization of transmission capacity. The proposed framework is validated on standard IEEE benchmark test systems, demonstrating its effectiveness under varying numbers and placements of impedance controllers.</p>

<h2>PedaCo-Gen: Scaffolding Pedagogical Agency in Human-AI Collaborative Video Authoring</h2>
<h3>Injun Baek, Yearim Kim, Nojun Kwak</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.19623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While advancements in Text-to-Video (T2V) generative AI offer a promising path toward democratizing content creation, current models are often optimized for visual fidelity rather than instructional efficacy. This study introduces PedaCo-Gen, a pedagogically-informed human-AI collaborative video generating system for authoring instructional videos based on Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML). Moving away from traditional "one-shot" generation, PedaCo-Gen introduces an Intermediate Representation (IR) phase, enabling educators to interactively review and refine video blueprints-comprising scripts and visual descriptions-with an AI reviewer. Our study with 23 education experts demonstrates that PedaCo-Gen significantly enhances video quality across various topics and CTML principles compared to baselines. Participants perceived the AI-driven guidance not merely as a set of instructions but as a metacognitive scaffold that augmented their instructional design expertise, reporting high production efficiency (M=4.26) and guide validity (M=4.04). These findings highlight the importance of reclaiming pedagogical agency through principled co-creation, providing a foundation for future AI authoring tools that harmonize generative power with human professional expertise.</p>

<h2>Towards Privacy-Aware Bayesian Networks: A Credal Approach</h2>
<h3>Niccol\`o Rocchi, Fabio Stella, Cassio de Campos</h3>
<p>arXiv:2509.18949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that enable efficient knowledge representation and inference. These have proven effective across diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The structure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly learned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes increasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive information in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize privacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine the released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals belong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection tecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this offers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the model's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the resulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of releasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks (CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After adapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the masking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful attacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve meaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key learning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from recovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical experiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN hyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical, and effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic graphical models.</p>
