<h2>Determining habitat anomalies in cross-diffusion predator-prey chemotaxis models</h2>
<h3>Yuhan Li, Hongyu Liu, Catharine W. K. Lo</h3>
<p>arXiv:2512.22946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses an open inverse problem at the interface of mathematical analysis and spatial ecology: the unique identification of unknown spatial anomalies -- interpreted as zones of habitat degradation -- and their associated ecological parameters in multi-species predator-prey systems with multiple chemical signals, using only boundary measurements. We formulate the problem as the simultaneous recovery of an unknown interior subdomain and discontinuous ecological interaction rules across its boundary. A unified theooretical framework is developed that unique determines both the anomaly's geometry and discontinuous coefficients characterizing the altered interactions within the degraded region. Our results cover smooth anomalies in time-dependent systems and are extended to non-smooth polyhedral inclusions in stationary regimes. This work bridges a gap between ecological sensing and the quantitative inference of internal habitat heterogeneity, offering a mathamtical basis for detecting and characterizing habitat degradation from limited external data.</p>

<h2>Hierarchical Pedagogical Oversight: A Multi-Agent Adversarial Framework for Reliable AI Tutoring</h2>
<h3>Saisab Sadhu, Ashim Dhor</h3>
<p>arXiv:2512.22496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automated tutors to address educator shortages; however, they often fail at pedagogical reasoning, frequently validating incorrect student solutions (sycophancy) or providing overly direct answers that hinder learning. We introduce Hierarchical Pedagogical Oversight (HPO), a framework that adapts structured adversarial synthesis to educational assessment. Unlike cooperative multi-agent systems that often drift toward superficial consensus, HPO enforces a dialectical separation of concerns: specialist agents first distill dialogue context, which then grounds a moderated, five-act debate between opposing pedagogical critics. We evaluate this framework on the MRBench dataset of 1,214 middle-school mathematics dialogues. Our 8B-parameter model achieves a Macro F1 of 0.845, outperforming GPT-4o (0.812) by 3.3% while using 20 times fewer parameters. These results establish adversarial reasoning as a critical mechanism for deploying reliable, low-compute pedagogical oversight in resource-constrained environments.</p>

Abstract: This study aims to evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of hybrid energy systems (HES) including Grid for providing reliable and sustainable power to Boru Meda Hospital, Ethiopia. HOMER pro 3.11.2 was used to design and evaluate a novel, integrated optimization and comparative assessment of diverse HRES, specif ically adjusted to the energy consumptions and available resources of the Hospital. The scenario evaluation showed that interconnecting photovoltaic (PV), biomass generator (BG), wind power (WP), diesel generator (DG), battery, and converter can effectively provide the Hospital's daily energy consumption of 11,214.66 kWh while conforming reliability and reducing emissions. The PV/BG/batt/conv configuration emerged as the most cost-effective and sustainable alternative, attaining the lowest LCOE of \$0.339/kWh, an NPC of \$25.7 million, and a 100% renewable energy fraction with simple pay back of 7.26 yr. As a result, the operational cost associated with the consumption of 500.00 L of diesel per month can be entirely avoided. The DG-integrated hybrids exhibit advanced techno-economic capability with significant worth, strong ROI (20\%) and IRR (18\%), endorsed by fast capital recovery (7.21-8.71 years). Overall, the hybrid system offers an optimal balance of cost, reliability, and sustainability, making it a promising and scalable solution for electrification of energy scare institution and areas in Ethiopia, thereby contributing to national sustainable energy development goals.</p>

<h2>Understanding EFL Learners' Code-Switching and Teachers' Pedagogical Approaches in LLM-Supported Speaking Practice</h2>
<h3>Junyeong Park, Jieun Han, Yeon Su Park, Youngbin Lee, Suin Kim, Juho Kim, Alice Oh, So-Yeon Ahn</h3>
<p>arXiv:2512.23136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners, code-switching (CSW), or alternating between their native language and the target language (English), can lower anxiety and ease communication barriers. Large language models (LLMs), with their multilingual abilities, offer new opportunities to support CSW in speaking practice. Yet, the pedagogical design of LLM-based tutors remains underexplored. To this end, we conducted a six-week study of LLM-mediated speaking practice with 20 Korean EFL learners, alongside a qualitative study with nine English teachers who designed and refined responses to learner CSW. Findings show that learners used CSW not only to bridge lexical gaps but also to express cultural and emotional nuance, prompting teachers to employ selective interventions and dynamic scaffolding strategies. We conclude with design implications for bilingual LLM-powered tutors that leverage teachers' expertise to transform CSW into meaningful learning opportunities.</p>

<h2>Domain matters: Towards domain-informed evaluation for link prediction</h2>
<h3>Yilin Bi, Junhao Bian, Shuyan Wan, Shuaijia Wang, Tao Zhou</h3>
<p>arXiv:2512.23371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction, a foundational task in complex network analysis, has extensive applications in critical scenarios such as social recommendation, drug target discovery, and knowledge graph completion. However, existing evaluations of algorithmic often rely on experiments conducted on a limited number of networks, assuming consistent performance rankings across domains. Despite the significant disparities in generative mechanisms and semantic contexts, previous studies often improperly highlight ``universally optimal" algorithms based solely on naive average over networks across domains. This paper systematically evaluates 12 mainstream link prediction algorithms across 740 real-world networks spanning seven domains. We present substantial empirical evidence elucidating the performance of algorithms in specific domains. This findings reveal a notably low degree of consistency in inter-domain algorithm rankings, a phenomenon that stands in stark contrast to the high degree of consistency observed within individual domains. Principal Component Analysis shows that response vectors formed by the rankings of the 12 algorithms cluster distinctly by domain in low-dimensional space, thus confirming domain attributes as a pivotal factor affecting algorithm performance. We propose a metric called Winner Score that could identify the superior algorithm in each domain: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for social networks, Neighborhood Overlap-aware Graph Neural Networks for economics, Graph Convolutional Networks for chemistry, and L3-based Resource Allocation for biology. However, these domain-specific top-performing algorithms tend to exhibit suboptimal performance in other domains. This finding underscores the importance of aligning an algorithm's mechanism with the network structure.</p>
