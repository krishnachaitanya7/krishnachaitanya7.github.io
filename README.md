Abstract: Natural terrain complexity often necessitates agile movements like jumping in animals to improve traversal efficiency. To enable similar capabilities in quadruped robots, complex real-time jumping maneuvers are required. Current research does not adequately address the problem of online omnidirectional jumping and neglects the robot's kinodynamic constraints during trajectory generation. This paper proposes a general and complete cascade online optimization framework for omnidirectional jumping for quadruped robots. Our solution systematically encompasses jumping trajectory generation, a trajectory tracking controller, and a landing controller. It also incorporates environmental perception to navigate obstacles that standard locomotion cannot bypass, such as jumping from high platforms. We introduce a novel jumping plane to parameterize omnidirectional jumping motion and formulate a tightly coupled optimization problem accounting for the kinodynamic constraints, simultaneously optimizing CoM trajectory, Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs), and joint states. To meet the online requirements, we propose an accelerated evolutionary algorithm as the trajectory optimizer to address the complexity of kinodynamic constraints. To ensure stability and accuracy in environmental perception post-landing, we introduce a coarse-to-fine relocalization method that combines global Branch and Bound (BnB) search with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for precise positioning during navigation and jumping. The proposed framework achieves jump trajectory generation in approximately 0.1 seconds with a warm start and has been successfully validated on two quadruped robots on uneven terrains. Additionally, we extend the framework's versatility to humanoid robots.</p>

Abstract: This paper examines the saturation of pressure signals during various handwriting tasks, including drawings, cursive text, capital words text, and signature, under different levels of fatigue. Experimental results demonstrate a significant rise in the proportion of saturated samples following strenuous exercise in tasks performed without resting wrist. The analysis of saturation highlights significant differences when comparing the results to the baseline situation and strenuous fatigue.</p>

Abstract: Statement of problem. Dental implant geometry affects the mechanical performance and fatigue behavior of butt-joint implant-supported restorations. However, failure of the implant component has been generally studied by ignoring the prosthetic screw, which is frequently the critical restoration component Purpose. Evaluate the effect of 3 main implant geometric parameters: the implant body diameter, the platform diameter, and the implant-abutment connection type (external versus internal butt-joint) on the fatigue life of the prosthetic screw. The experimental values were further compared with the theoretical ones obtained by using a previously published methodology M&amp;M. 4 different designs of direct-to-implant dental restorations from the manufacturer BTI were tested. Forty-eight fatigue tests were performed in an axial fatigue testing machine according to ISO 14801. Linear regression models, 95% interval confidence bands for the linear regression, and 95% prediction intervals of the fatigue load-life results were obtained and compared through an analysis of covariance to determine the influence of the 3 parameters under study on the fatigue behavior Results. Linear regression models showed a statistical difference when the implant body diameter was increased by 1 mm; an average 3.5-fold increase in fatigue life was observed. Increasing the implant abutment connection diameter by 1.4 mm also showed a significant difference, leading to 7-fold longer fatigue life on average. No significant statistical evidence was found to demonstrate a difference in fatigue life between internal and external connections Conclusions. Increasing the implant platform and body diameter significantly improved the fatigue life of the screw, whereas external and internal connections provided similar results. In addition, experimental results proved the accuracy of the fatigue life prediction methodology</p>

<h2>Conformalized Credal Regions for Classification with Ambiguous Ground Truth</h2>
<h3>Michele Caprio, David Stutz, Shuo Li, Arnaud Doucet</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.04852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An open question in \emph{Imprecise Probabilistic Machine Learning} is how to empirically derive a credal region (i.e., a closed and convex family of probabilities on the output space) from the available data, without any prior knowledge or assumption. In classification problems, credal regions are a tool that is able to provide provable guarantees under realistic assumptions by characterizing the uncertainty about the distribution of the labels. Building on previous work, we show that credal regions can be directly constructed using conformal methods. This allows us to provide a novel extension of classical conformal prediction to problems with ambiguous ground truth, that is, when the exact labels for given inputs are not exactly known. The resulting construction enjoys desirable practical and theoretical properties: (i) conformal coverage guarantees, (ii) smaller prediction sets (compared to classical conformal prediction regions) and (iii) disentanglement of uncertainty sources (epistemic, aleatoric). We empirically verify our findings on both synthetic and real datasets.</p>
