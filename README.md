<h2>Stochastic positivity-preserving symplectic splitting methods for stochastic Lotka--Volterra predator-prey model</h2>
<h3>Liying Zhang, Xinyue Kang, Lihai Ji</h3>
<p>arXiv:2504.02228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two stochastic positive-preserving symplectic methods for the stochastic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model driven by a multiplicative noise. To inherit the intrinsic characteristic of the original system, the stochastic Lie--Trotter splitting method and the stochastic Strang splitting method are introduced, which are proved to preserve the positivity of the numerical solution and possess the discrete stochastic symplectic conservation law as well. By deriving the uniform boundedness of the $p$-th moment of the numerical solution, we prove that the strong convergence orders of these two methods are both one in the $L^2(\Omega)$-norm. Finally, we validate the theoretical results through two and four dimensional numerical examples.</p>

<h2>Impedance and Stability Targeted Adaptation for Aerial Manipulator with Unknown Coupling Dynamics</h2>
<h3>Amitabh Sharma, Saksham Gupta, Shivansh Pratap Singh, Rishabh Dev Yadav, Hongyu Song, Wei Pan, Spandan Roy, Simone Baldi</h3>
<p>arXiv:2504.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable aerial manipulation during dynamic tasks such as object catching, perching, or contact with rigid surfaces necessarily requires compliant behavior, which is often achieved via impedance control. Successful manipulation depends on how effectively the impedance control can tackle the unavoidable coupling forces between the aerial vehicle and the manipulator. However, the existing impedance controllers for aerial manipulator either ignore these coupling forces (in partitioned system compliance methods) or require their precise knowledge (in complete system compliance methods). Unfortunately, such forces are very difficult to model, if at all possible. To solve this long-standing control challenge, we introduce an impedance controller for aerial manipulator which does not rely on a priori knowledge of the system dynamics and of the coupling forces. The impedance control design can address unknown coupling forces, along with system parametric uncertainties, via suitably designed adaptive laws. The closed-loop system stability is proved analytically and experimental results with a payload-catching scenario demonstrate significant improvements in overall stability and tracking over the state-of-the-art impedance controllers using either partitioned or complete system compliance.</p>

<h2>Bipedal Robust Walking on Uneven Footholds: Piecewise Slope LIPM with Discrete Model Predictive Control</h2>
<h3>Yapeng Shi, Sishu Li, Yongqiang Wu, Junjie Liu, Xiaokun Leng, Xizhe Zang, Songhao Piao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2504.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an enhanced theoretical formulation for bipedal hierarchical control frameworks under uneven terrain conditions. Specifically, owing to the inherent limitations of the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) in handling terrain elevation variations, we develop a Piecewise Slope LIPM (PS-LIPM). This innovative model enables dynamic adjustment of the Center of Mass (CoM) height to align with topographical undulations during single-step cycles. Another contribution is proposed a generalized Angular Momentum-based LIPM (G-ALIP) for CoM velocity compensation using Centroidal Angular Momentum (CAM) regulation. Building upon these advancements, we derive the DCM step-to-step dynamics for Model Predictive Control MPC formulation, enabling simultaneous optimization of step position and step duration. A hierarchical control framework integrating MPC with a Whole-Body Controller (WBC) is implemented for bipedal locomotion across uneven stepping stones. The results validate the efficacy of the proposed hierarchical control framework and the theoretical formulation.</p>

<h2>HCAF-DTA: drug-target binding affinity prediction with cross-attention fused hypergraph neural networks</h2>
<h3>Jiannuo Li, Lan Yao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2504.02014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the binding affinity between drugs and target proteins is a core task in computer-aided drug design. Existing deep learning methods tend to ignore the information of internal sub-structural features of drug molecules and drug-target interactions, resulting in limited prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a drug-target association prediction model HCAF-DTA based on cross-attention fusion hypergraph neural network. The model innovatively introduces hypergraph representation in the feature extraction stage: drug molecule hypergraphs are constructed based on the tree decomposition algorithm, and the sub-structural and global features extracted by fusing the hypergraph neural network with the graphical neural network through hopping connections, in which the hyper edges can efficiently characterise the functional functional groups and other key chemical features; for the protein feature extraction, a weighted graph is constructed based on the residues predicted by the ESM model contact maps to construct weighted graphs, and multilayer graph neural networks were used to capture spatial dependencies. In the prediction stage, a bidirectional multi-head cross-attention mechanism is designed to model intermolecular interactions from the dual viewpoints of atoms and amino acids, and cross-modal features with correlated information are fused by attention. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Davis and KIBA show that HCAF-DTA outperforms state of the arts in all three performance evaluation metrics, with the MSE metrics reaching 0.198 and 0.122, respectively, with an improvement of up to 4% from the optimal baseline.</p>

<h2>Exceedance and force of centrality for functional data</h2>
<h3>Poorbita Kundu, Hang Zhou, Hans-Georg M\"uller</h3>
<p>arXiv:2504.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceedance refers to instances where a dynamic process surpasses given thresholds, e.g., the occurrence of a heat wave. We propose a novel exceedance framework for functional data, where each observed random trajectory is transformed into an exceedance function, which quantifies exceedance durations as a function of threshold levels. An inherent relationship between exceedance functions and probability distributions makes it possible to draw on distributional data analysis techniques such as Fr\'echet regression to study the dependence of exceedances on Euclidean predictors, e.g., calendar year when the exceedances are observed. We use local linear estimators to obtain exceedance functions from discretely observed functional data with noise and study the convergence of the proposed estimators. New concepts of interest include the force of centrality that quantifies the propensity of a system to revert to lower levels when a given threshold has been exceeded, conditional exceedance functions when conditioning on Euclidean covariates, and threshold exceedance functions, which characterize the size of exceedance sets in dependence on covariates for any fixed threshold. We establish consistent estimation with rates of convergence for these targets. The practical merits of the proposed methodology are illustrated through simulations and applications for annual temperature curves and medfly activity profiles.</p>
