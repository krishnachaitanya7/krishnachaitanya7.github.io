Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method for recovering the internal conductivity of a physical body from electric boundary measurements. EIT combined with machine learning has shown promise for the classification of strokes. However, most previous works have used raw EIT voltage data as network inputs. We build upon a recent development which suggested the use of special noise-robust Virtual Hybrid Edge Detection (VHED) functions as network inputs, although that work used only highly simplified and mathematically ideal models. In this work we strengthen the case for the use of EIT, and VHED functions especially, for stroke classification. We design models with high detail and mathematical realism to test the use of VHED functions as inputs. Virtual patients are created using a physically detailed 2D head model which includes features known to create challenges in real-world imaging scenarios. Conductivity values are drawn from statistically realistic distributions, and phantoms are afflicted with either hemorrhagic or ischemic strokes of various shapes and sizes. Simulated noisy EIT electrode data, generated using the realistic Complete Electrode Model (CEM) as opposed to the mathematically ideal continuum model, is processed to obtain VHED functions. We compare the use of VHED functions as inputs against the alternative paradigm of using raw EIT voltages. Our results show that (i) stroke classification can be performed with high accuracy using 2D EIT data from physically detailed and mathematically realistic models, and (ii) in the presence of noise, VHED functions outperform raw data as network inputs.</p>

<h2>A Logvinenko-Sereda theorem for vector-valued functions and application to control theory</h2>

<p>arXiv:2401.09159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Logvinenko-Sereda Theorem for vector valued functions. That is, for an arbitrary Banach space $X$, all $p \in [1,\infty]$, all $\lambda \in (0,\infty)^d$, all $f \in L^p (\mathbb{R}^d ; X)$ with $\operatorname{supp} \mathcal{F} f \in \times_{i=1}^d (-\lambda_i/2 , \lambda_i /2)$, and all thick sets $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ we have \begin{equation*} \lVert \mathbf{1}_E f \rVert_{L^p (\mathbb{R}^d)} \geq C \lVert f \rVert_{L^p (\mathbb{R}^d)} . \end{equation*} The constant is explicitly known in dependence of the geometric parameters of the thick set and the parameter $\lambda$. As an application, we study control theory for normally elliptic operators on Banach spaces whose coefficients of their symbol are given by bounded linear operators. This includes systems of coupled parabolic equations or problems depending on a parameter.</p>
