Abstract: Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation is a fundamental step in many machine learning and data analysis algorithms. In real-world applications, however, these distances are frequently distorted by heteroskedastic noise$\unicode{x2014}$a prevalent form of inhomogeneous corruption characterized by variable noise magnitudes across data observations. Such noise inflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to misrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address the tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior knowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be performed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably. Specifically, we develop a principled, hyperparameter-free approach that jointly estimates the noise magnitudes and corrects the distances. We provide theoretical guarantees for our approach, establishing probabilistic bounds on the estimation errors of both noise magnitudes and distances. These bounds, measured in the normalized $\ell_1$ norm, converge to zero at polynomial rates as both feature dimension and dataset size increase. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method accurately estimates distances in challenging regimes, significantly improving the robustness of subsequent distance-based computations. Notably, when applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data, our method yields noise magnitude estimates consistent with an established prototypical model, enabling accurate nearest neighbor identification that is fundamental to many downstream analyses.</p>

Abstract: Fatigue detection plays a critical role in safety-critical applications such as aviation, mining, and long-haul transport. However, most existing methods rely on high-end sensors and controlled environments, limiting their applicability in real world settings. This paper formally defines a practical yet underexplored problem setting for real world fatigue detection, where systems operating with context-appropriate sensors aim to leverage knowledge from differently instrumented sources including those using impractical sensors deployed in controlled environments. To tackle this challenge, we propose a heterogeneous and multi-source fatigue detection framework that adaptively utilizes the available modalities in the target domain while benefiting from the diverse configurations present in source domains. Our experiments, conducted using a realistic field-deployed sensor setup and two publicly available datasets, demonstrate the practicality, robustness, and improved generalization of our approach, paving the practical way for effective fatigue monitoring in sensor-constrained scenarios.</p>
