<h2>$L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^p$-Carleson measures on compact manifolds</h2>
<h3>Xing Wang, Xiangjin Xu, Cheng Zhang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.22759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marzo and Ortega-Cerd\`a gave geometric characterizations for $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets on the standard sphere for all $1\le p<\infty$. Later, Ortega-Cerd\`a and Pridhnani further investigated $L^2$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^2$-Carleson measures on compact manifolds without boundary. In this paper, we characterize $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^p$-Carleson measures on compact manifolds with or without boundary for all $1 \frac{2m}{m-1}$. For the range $p < \frac{2m}{m-1}$, we conjecture that $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets for eigenfunctions on the standard sphere $S^m$ are characterized by the tubular geometric control condition and we provide some evidence. These results provide new progress on an open problem raised by Ortega-Cerd\`a and Pridhnani.</p>

<h2>The Streda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Cesaro Summation</h2>
<h3>Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Gonzalo Usaj, Nathan Goldman</h3>
<p>arXiv:2408.13576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The St\v{r}eda formula establishes a fundamental connection between the topological invariants characterizing the bulk of topological matter and the presence of gapless edge modes. In this work, we extend the St\v{r}eda formula to periodically driven systems, providing a rigorous framework to elucidate the unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet systems, while offering a link between Floquet winding numbers and tractable response functions. Using the Sambe representation of periodically driven systems, we analyze the response of the unbounded Floquet density of states to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-St\v{r}eda response is regularized through Ces\`aro summation, yielding a well-defined, quantized result within spectral gaps. The response features two physically distinct contributions: a quantized charge flow between edge and bulk, and an anomalous energy flow between the system and the drive, offering new insight into the nature of anomalous edge states. This result rigorously connects Floquet winding numbers to the orbital magnetization density of Floquet states and holds broadly, from clean to disordered and inhomogeneous systems. This is further supported by providing a real-space formulation of the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response, which introduces a local topological marker suited for periodically driven settings. In translationally-invariant systems, the framework yields a remarkably simple expression for Floquet winding numbers involving geometric properties of Floquet-Bloch bands. A concrete experimental protocol is proposed to extract the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response via particle-density measurements in systems coupled to engineered baths. Finally, by expressing the topological invariants through the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, this approach opens a promising route toward the topological characterization of interacting driven phases.</p>

<h2>ANN-Based Grid Impedance Estimation for Adaptive Gain Scheduling in VSG Under Dynamic Grid Conditions</h2>
<h3>Quang-Manh Hoang, Van Nam Nguyen, Taehyung Kim, Guilherme Vieira Hollweg, Wencong Su, Van-Hai Bui</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.23304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to grid-following inverters, Virtual Synchronous Generators (VSGs) perform well under weak grid conditions but may become unstable when the grid is strong. Grid strength depends on grid impedance, which unfortunately varies over time. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive gain-scheduling control scheme for VSGs. First, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) estimates the fundamental-frequency grid impedance; then these estimates are fed into an adaptive gain-scheduling function to recalculate controller parameters under varying grid conditions. The proposed method is validated in Simulink and compared with a conventional VSG employing fixed controller gains. The results demonstrate that settling times and overshoot percentages remain consistent across different grid conditions. Additionally, previously unseen grid impedance values are estimated with high accuracy and minimal time delay, making the approach well suited for real-time gain-scheduling control.</p>

<p>arXiv:2506.09113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Notable breakthroughs in diffusion modeling have propelled rapid improvements in video generation, yet current foundational model still face critical challenges in simultaneously balancing prompt following, motion plausibility, and visual quality. In this report, we introduce Seedance 1.0, a high-performance and inference-efficient video foundation generation model that integrates several core technical improvements: (i) multi-source data curation augmented with precision and meaningful video captioning, enabling comprehensive learning across diverse scenarios; (ii) an efficient architecture design with proposed training paradigm, which allows for natively supporting multi-shot generation and jointly learning of both text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. (iii) carefully-optimized post-training approaches leveraging fine-grained supervised fine-tuning, and video-specific RLHF with multi-dimensional reward mechanisms for comprehensive performance improvements; (iv) excellent model acceleration achieving ~10x inference speedup through multi-stage distillation strategies and system-level optimizations. Seedance 1.0 can generate a 5-second video at 1080p resolution only with 41.4 seconds (NVIDIA-L20). Compared to state-of-the-art video generation models, Seedance 1.0 stands out with high-quality and fast video generation having superior spatiotemporal fluidity with structural stability, precise instruction adherence in complex multi-subject contexts, native multi-shot narrative coherence with consistent subject representation.</p>

<h2>Improving Student-AI Interaction Through Pedagogical Prompting: An Example in Computer Science Education</h2>
<h3>Ruiwei Xiao, Xinying Hou, Runlong Ye, Majeed Kazemitabaar, Nicholas Diana, Michael Liut, John Stamper</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.19107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the proliferation of large language model (LLM) applications since 2022, their use in education has sparked both excitement and concern. Recent studies consistently highlight students' (mis)use of LLMs can hinder learning outcomes. This work aims to teach students how to effectively prompt LLMs to improve their learning. We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education (CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners' LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future. Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting; (2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching LLM-based help-seeking. Our approach is scalable for broader implementation in classrooms and has the potential to be integrated into tools like ChatGPT as an on-boarding experience to encourage learning-oriented use of generative AI.</p>

<h2>Skill-Nav: Enhanced Navigation with Versatile Quadrupedal Locomotion via Waypoint Interface</h2>
<h3>Dewei Wang, Chenjia Bai, Chenhui Li, Jiyuan Shi, Yan Ding, Chi Zhang, Bin Zhao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.21853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated exceptional locomotion capabilities through Reinforcement Learning (RL), including extreme parkour maneuvers. However, integrating locomotion skills with navigation in quadrupedal robots has not been fully investigated, which holds promise for enhancing long-distance movement capabilities. In this paper, we propose Skill-Nav, a method that incorporates quadrupedal locomotion skills into a hierarchical navigation framework using waypoints as an interface. Specifically, we train a waypoint-guided locomotion policy using deep RL, enabling the robot to autonomously adjust its locomotion skills to reach targeted positions while avoiding obstacles. Compared with direct velocity commands, waypoints offer a simpler yet more flexible interface for high-level planning and low-level control. Utilizing waypoints as the interface allows for the application of various general planning tools, such as large language models (LLMs) and path planning algorithms, to guide our locomotion policy in traversing terrains with diverse obstacles. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate that Skill-Nav can effectively traverse complex terrains and complete challenging navigation tasks.</p>

<h2>Covariate-informed link prediction with extreme taxonomic bias</h2>
<h3>Jennifer N. Kampe, Camille DeSisto, David B. Dunson</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.23370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biotic interactions provide a valuable window into the inner workings of complex ecological communities and capture the loss of ecological function often precipitated by environmental change. However, the financial and logistical challenges associated with collecting interaction data result in networks that are recorded with geographical and taxonomic bias, particularly when studies are narrowly focused. We develop an approach to reduce bias in link prediction in the common scenario in which data are derived from studies focused on a small number of species. Our Extended Covariate-Informed Link Prediction (COIL+) framework utilizes a latent factor model that flexibly borrows information between species and incorporates dependence on covariates and phylogeny, and introduces a framework for borrowing information from multiple studies to reduce bias due to uncertain species occurrence. Additionally, we propose a new trait matching procedure which permits heterogeneity in trait-interaction propensity associations at the species level. We illustrate the approach through an application to a literature compilation data set of 268 sources reporting frugivory in Afrotropical forests and compare the performance with and without correction for uncertainty in occurrence. Our method results in a substantial improvement in link prediction, revealing 5,255 likely but unobserved frugivory interactions, and increasing model discrimination under conditions of great taxonomic bias and narrow study focus. This framework generalizes to a variety of network contexts and offers a useful tool for link prediction given networks recorded with bias.</p>
