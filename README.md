<h2>Learning-Enhanced Variational Regularization for Electrical Impedance Tomography via Calder\'on's Method</h2>
<h3>Kai Li, Kwancheol Shin, Zhi Zhou</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.06114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to numerically solve the two-dimensional electrical impedance tomography (EIT) with Cauchy data. This inverse problem is highly challenging due to its severe ill-posed nature and strong nonlinearity, which necessitates appropriate regularization strategies. Choosing a regularization approach that effectively incorporates the \textit{a priori} information of the conductivity distribution (or its contrast) is therefore essential. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based method to capture the \textit{a priori} information about the shape and location of the unknown contrast using Calder\'on's method. The learned \textit{a priori} information is then used to construct the regularization functional of the variational regularization method for solving the inverse problem. The resulting regularized variational problem for EIT reconstruction is then solved using the Gauss-Newton method. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed inversion algorithm achieves accurate reconstruction results, even in high-contrast cases, and exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Additionally, some stability and convergence analysis of the variational regularization method underscores the importance of incorporating \textit{a priori} information about the support of the unknown contrast.</p>

<h2>Bridging MOOCs, Smart Teaching, and AI: A Decade of Evolution Toward a Unified Pedagogy</h2>
<h3>Bo Yuan, Jiazi Hu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.14266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, higher education has evolved through three distinct paradigms: the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), the integration of Smart Teaching technologies into classrooms, and the rise of AI-enhanced learning. Each paradigm is intended to address specific challenges in traditional education: MOOCs enable ubiquitous access to learning resources; Smart Teaching supports real-time interaction with data-driven insights; and generative AI offers personalized feedback and on-demand content generation. However, these paradigms are often implemented in isolation due to their disparate technological origins and policy-driven adoption. This paper examines the origins, strengths, and limitations of each paradigm, and advocates a unified pedagogical perspective that synthesizes their complementary affordances. We propose a three-layer instructional framework that combines the scalability of MOOCs, the responsiveness of Smart Teaching, and the adaptivity of AI. To demonstrate its feasibility, we present a curriculum design for a project-based course. The findings highlight the framework's potential to enhance learner engagement, support instructors, and enable personalized yet scalable learning.</p>

<h2>Koopman Operator Based Time-Delay Embeddings and State History Augmented LQR for Periodic Hybrid Systems: Bouncing Pendulum and Bipedal Walking</h2>
<h3>Chun-Ming Yang, Pranav A. Bhounsule</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delay embedding is a technique that uses snapshots of state history over time to build a linear state space model of a nonlinear smooth system. We demonstrate that periodic non-smooth or hybrid system can also be modeled as a linear state space system using this approach as long as its behavior is consistent in modes and timings. We extended time-delay embeddings to generate a linear model of two periodic hybrid systems: the bouncing pendulum and the simplest walker with control inputs. This leads to a novel state history augmented linear quadratic regulator (LQR) which uses current and past state history for feedback control.</p>

<h2>Strategic Integration of AI Chatbots in Physics Teacher Preparation: A TPACK-SWOT Analysis of Pedagogical, Epistemic, and Cybersecurity Dimensions</h2>
<h3>N. Mohammadipour</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.14860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the strategic and epistemically responsible integration of AI-powered chatbots into physics teacher education by employing a TPACK-guided SWOT framework across three structured learning activities. Conducted within a university-level capstone course on innovative tools for physics instruction, the activities targeted key intersections of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) through chatbot-assisted tasks: simplifying abstract physics concepts, constructing symbolic concept maps, and designing instructional scenarios. Drawing on participant reflections, classroom artifacts, and iterative feedback, the results highlight internal strengths such as enhanced information-seeking behavior, scaffolded pedagogical planning, and support for symbolic reasoning. At the same time, internal weaknesses emerged, including domain-specific inaccuracies, symbolic limitations (e.g., LaTeX misrendering), and risks of overreliance on AI outputs. External opportunities were found in promoting inclusive education, multilingual engagement, and expanded zones of proximal development (ZPD), while external threats included prompt injection risks, institutional access gaps, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. By extending existing TPACK-based models with constructs such as AI literacy, prompt-crafting competence, and epistemic verification protocols, this research offers a theoretically grounded and practically actionable roadmap for embedding AI in STEM teacher preparation. The findings affirm that, when critically scaffolded, AI chatbots can support metacognitive reflection, ethical reasoning, and instructional innovation in physics education if implementation is paired with digital fluency training and institutional support.</p>

<h2>AI-Based Impedance Encoding-Decoding Method for Online Impedance Network Construction of Wind Farms</h2>
<h3>Xiaojuan Zhang, Tianyu Jiang, Haoxiang Zong, Chen Zhang, Chendan Li, Marta Molinas</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.14187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impedance network (IN) model is gaining popularity in the oscillation analysis of wind farms. However, the construction of such an IN model requires impedance curves of each wind turbine under their respective operating conditions, making its online application difficult due to the transmission of numerous high-density impedance curves. To address this issue, this paper proposes an AI-based impedance encoding-decoding method to facilitate the online construction of IN model. First, an impedance encoder is trained to compress impedance curves by setting the number of neurons much smaller than that of frequency points. Then, the compressed data of each turbine are uploaded to the wind farm and an impedance decoder is trained to reconstruct original impedance curves. At last, based on the nodal admittance matrix (NAM) method, the IN model of the wind farm can be obtained. The proposed method is validated via model training and real-time simulations, demonstrating that the encoded impedance vectors enable fast transmission and accurate reconstruction of the original impedance curves.</p>

<h2>Testing Homogeneity in a heteroscedastic contaminated normal mixture</h2>
<h3>Xiaoqing Niu, Pengfei Li, Yuejiao Fu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.15630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale simultaneous hypothesis testing appears in many areas such as microarray studies, genome-wide association studies, brain imaging, disease mapping and astronomical surveys. A well-known inference method is to control the false discovery rate. One popular approach is to model the $z$-scores derived from the individual $t$-tests and then use this model to control the false discovery rate. We propose a new class of contaminated normal mixtures for modelling $z$-scores. We further design an EM-test for testing homogeneity in this class of mixture models. We show that the EM-test statistic has a shifted mixture of chi-squared limiting distribution. Simulation results show that the proposed testing procedure has accurate type I error and significantly larger power than its competitors under a variety of model specifications. A real-data example is analyzed to exemplify the application of the proposed method.</p>
