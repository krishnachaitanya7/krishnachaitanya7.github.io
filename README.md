<h2>LEAP -- Live Experiments for Active Pedagogy</h2>
<h3>Sumedh Karajagi, Sampad Bhusan Mohanty, Bhaskar Krishnamachari</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.22534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive computational environments can help students explore algorithmic concepts through collaborative hands-on experimentation. However, static and instructor controlled demos in lectures limit engagement. Even when interactive visualizations are used, interactions are solely controlled by the instructor, leaving students as passive observers. In addition, the tools used for demonstration often vary significantly, as they are typically developed by individual instructors. Consequently, the visualizations remain confined to a single classroom, rather than being shared and adapted across courses or reused by other instructors. To address this gap and foster active engagement in live classrooms, we present a lightweight and seamless software framework named LEAP for developing interactive computational lab exercises using a simple idea: remotely callable instructor-defined functions. Using API endpoints and a provided client, students can discover and then call instructor defined functions remotely from their coding environment using scripts or interactive notebooks. Each function call is time-stamped and persistently logged in a database, allowing real-time visualization of participation, diverse solution paths, common pitfalls, and live feedback through collaboration, gamification, and quizzes. Labs are packaged as self-contained folders, each containing their own remotely callable functions. We provide example labs to demonstrate applications relevant for numerical analysis, machine learning, algorithms courses and mention some in electrical engineering (EE), economics, and physics. These capabilities enhance engagement and provide instructors with actionable insights into learning processes. With a standardized lab format and an online directory for community-contributed labs, we aim to foster a global ecosystem for exchanging and expanding interactive pedagogy enabled by LEAP.</p>

<h2>On Safer Reinforcement Learning Policies for Sedation and Analgesia in Intensive Care</h2>
<h3>Joel Romero-Hernandez, Oscar Camara</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.23154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pain management in intensive care usually involves complex trade-offs between therapeutic goals and patient safety, since both inadequate and excessive treatment may induce serious sequelae. Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective.</p>

<h2>Network analysis and link prediction in competitive women's basketball</h2>
<h3>Anthony Bonato, Morganna Hinds</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.23193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network structure and its role in prediction are examined in competitive basketball at the team and player levels. Adversarial game outcome networks from NCAA Division I women's basketball from 2021 to 2024 are used to compute the common out-neighbor score and PageRank, which are combined into a low-key leader strength that identifies competitors influential through structural similarity despite relatively low centrality. This measure is related to changes in NCAA NET rankings by grouping teams into quantiles and comparing average rank changes across seasons for both previous-to-current and current-to-next transitions. Link prediction is then studied using node2vec embeddings across three interaction settings. For NCAA regular-season game networks, cosine similarity between team embeddings is used in a logistic regression model to predict March Madness matchups. For WNBA shot-blocking networks, future directed blocking interactions are predicted via logistic regression on concatenated source-target player embeddings. For WNBA passing networks, region embeddings learned from first-quarter passes are evaluated for their ability to predict subsequent passing connections. Across NCAA and WNBA settings, embedding-based models provide statistically significant evidence that higher-order network structure contains predictive signals for future interactions, while the passing experiment shows weaker predictive performance but yields interpretable similarity patterns consistent with passing feasibility.</p>

<h2>Disentangling multispecific antibody function with graph neural networks</h2>
<h3>Joshua Southern, Changpeng Lu, Santrupti Nerli, Samuel D. Stanton, Andrew M. Watkins, Franziska Seeger, Fr\'ed\'eric A. Dreyer</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.23212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multispecific antibodies offer transformative therapeutic potential by engaging multiple epitopes simultaneously, yet their efficacy is an emergent property governed by complex molecular architectures. Rational design is often bottlenecked by the inability to predict how subtle changes in domain topology influence functional outcomes, a challenge exacerbated by the scarcity of comprehensive experimental data. Here, we introduce a computational framework to address part of this gap. First, we present a generative method for creating large-scale, realistic synthetic functional landscapes that capture non-linear interactions where biological activity depends on domain connectivity. Second, we propose a graph neural network architecture that explicitly encodes these topological constraints, distinguishing between format configurations that appear identical to sequence-only models. We demonstrate that this model, trained on synthetic landscapes, recapitulates complex functional properties and, via transfer learning, has the potential to achieve high predictive accuracy on limited biological datasets. We showcase the model's utility by optimizing trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity in trispecific T-cell engagers and retrieving optimal common light chains. This work provides a robust benchmarking environment for disentangling the combinatorial complexity of multispecifics, accelerating the design of next-generation therapeutics.</p>
