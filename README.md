<h2>AIMS: An Adaptive Integration of Multi-Sensor Measurements for Quadrupedal Robot Localization</h2>
<h3>Yujian Qiu, Yuqiu Mu, Wen Yang, Hao Zhu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of accurate localization for quadrupedal robots operating in narrow tunnel-like environments. Due to the long and homogeneous characteristics of such scenarios, LiDAR measurements often provide weak geometric constraints, making traditional sensor fusion methods susceptible to accumulated motion estimation errors. To address these challenges, we propose AIMS, an adaptive LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry fusion method for robust quadrupedal robot localization in degenerate environments. The proposed method is formulated within an error-state Kalman filtering framework, where LiDAR and leg odometry measurements are integrated with IMU-based state prediction, and measurement noise covariance matrices are adaptively adjusted based on online degeneracy-aware reliability assessment. Experimental results obtained in narrow corridor environments demonstrate that the proposed method improves localization accuracy and robustness compared with state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

Abstract: This paper extends a previously proposed fall prediction algorithm to a real-time (online) setting, with implementations in both hardware and simulation. The system is validated on the full-sized bipedal robot Digit, where the real-time version achieves performance comparable to the offline implementation while maintaining a zero false positive rate, an average lead time (defined as the difference between the true and predicted fall time) of 1.1s (well above the required minimum of 0.2s), and a maximum lead time error of just 0.03s. It also achieves a high recovery rate of 0.97, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world deployment. In addition to the real-time implementation, this work identifies key limitations of the original algorithm, particularly under omnidirectional faults, and introduces a fine-tuned strategy to improve robustness. The enhanced algorithm shows measurable improvements across all evaluated metrics, including a 0.05 reduction in average false positive rate and a 1.19s decrease in the maximum error of the average predicted lead time.</p>

<h2>Pedagogical Reflections on the Holistic Cognitive Development (HCD) Framework and AI-Augmented Learning in Creative Computing</h2>

<p>arXiv:2511.06779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an expanded account of the Holistic Cognitive Development (HCD) framework for reflective and creative learning in computing education. The HCD framework integrates design thinking, experiential learning, and reflective practice into a unified constructivist pedagogy emphasizing autonomy, ownership, and scaffolding. It is applied across courses in game design (CS3247, CS4350), virtual reality (CS4240), and extended reality systems, where students engage in iterative cycles of thinking, creating, criticizing, and reflecting. The paper also examines how AI-augmented systems such as iReflect, ReflexAI, and Knowledge Graph-enhanced LLM feedback tools operationalize the HCD framework through scalable, personalized feedback. Empirical findings demonstrate improved reflective depth, feedback quality, and learner autonomy. The work advocates a balance of supportive autonomy in supervision, where students practice self-directed inquiry while guided through structured reflection and feedback.</p>

<h2>Diagnosing Heteroskedasticity and Resolving Multicollinearity Paradoxes in Physicochemical Property Prediction</h2>

<p>arXiv:2512.24643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lipophilicity (logP) prediction remains central to drug discovery, yet linear regression models for this task frequently violate statistical assumptions in ways that invalidate their reported performance metrics. We analyzed 426,850 bioactive molecules from a rigorously curated intersection of PubChem, ChEMBL, and eMolecules databases, revealing severe heteroskedasticity in linear models predicting computed logP values (XLOGP3): residual variance increases 4.2-fold in lipophilic regions (logP greater than 5) compared to balanced regions (logP 2 to 4). Classical remediation strategies (Weighted Least Squares and Box-Cox transformation) failed to resolve this violation (Breusch-Pagan p-value less than 0.0001 for all variants). Tree-based ensemble methods (Random Forest R-squared of 0.764, XGBoost R-squared of 0.765) proved inherently robust to heteroskedasticity while delivering superior predictive performance. SHAP analysis resolved a critical multicollinearity paradox: despite a weak bivariate correlation of 0.146, molecular weight emerged as the single most important predictor (mean absolute SHAP value of 0.573), with its effect suppressed in simple correlations by confounding with topological polar surface area (TPSA). These findings demonstrate that standard linear models face fundamental challenges for computed lipophilicity prediction and provide a principled framework for interpreting ensemble models in QSAR applications.</p>
