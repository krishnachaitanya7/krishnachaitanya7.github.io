<h2>Uncertainty quantification for electrical impedance tomography using quasi-Monte Carlo methods</h2>
<h3>Laura Bazahica, Vesa Kaarnioja, Lassi Roininen</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.11538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical development of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for uncertainty quantification of partial differential equations (PDEs) is typically centered around simplified model problems such as elliptic PDEs subject to homogeneous zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this paper, we present a theoretical treatment of the application of randomly shifted rank-1 lattice rules to electrical impedance tomography (EIT). EIT is an imaging modality, where the goal is to reconstruct the interior conductivity of an object based on electrode measurements of current and voltage taken at the boundary of the object. This is an inverse problem, which we tackle using the Bayesian statistical inversion paradigm. As the reconstruction, we consider QMC integration to approximate the unknown conductivity given current and voltage measurements. We prove under moderate assumptions placed on the parameterization of the unknown conductivity that the QMC approximation of the reconstructed estimate has a dimension-independent, faster-than-Monte Carlo cubature convergence rate. Finally, we present numerical results for examples computed using simulated measurement data.</p>

<h2>Pedagogical Design Considerations for Mobile Augmented Reality Serious Games (MARSGs): A Literature Review</h2>
<h3>Cassidy R. Nelson, Joseph L. Gabbard</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.10655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As technology advances, conceptualizations of effective strategies for teaching and learning shift. Due in part to their facilitation of unique affordances for learning, mobile devices, augmented reality, and games are all becoming more prominent elements in learning environments. In this work, we examine mobile augmented reality serious games (MARSGs) as the intersection of these technology-based experiences and to what effect their combination can yield even greater learning outcomes. We present a PRISMA review of 23 papers (from 610) spanning the entire literature timeline from 2002 to 2023. Among these works, there is wide variability in the realized application of game elements and pedagogical theories underpinning the game experience. For an educational tool to be effective, it must be designed to facilitate learning while anchored by pedagogical theory. Given that most MARSG developers are not pedagogical experts, this review further provides design considerations regarding which game elements might proffer the best of three major pedagogical theories for modern learning (cognitive constructivism, social constructivism, and behaviorism) based on existing applications. We will also briefly touch on radical constructivism and the instructional elements embedded within MARSGs. Lastly, this work offers a synthesis of current MARSG findings and extended future directions for MARSG development.</p>

Abstract: Graph clustering is an important unsupervised learning technique for partitioning graphs with attributes and detecting communities. However, current methods struggle to accurately capture true community structures and intra-cluster relations, be computationally efficient, and identify smaller communities. We address these challenges by integrating coarsening and modularity maximization, effectively leveraging both adjacency and node features to enhance clustering accuracy. We propose a loss function incorporating log-determinant, smoothness, and modularity components using a block majorization-minimization technique, resulting in superior clustering outcomes. The method is theoretically consistent under the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model (DC-SBM), ensuring asymptotic error-free performance and complete label recovery. Our provably convergent and time-efficient algorithm seamlessly integrates with graph neural networks (GNNs) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) to learn enhanced node features and deliver exceptional clustering performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods for both attributed and non-attributed graphs.</p>
