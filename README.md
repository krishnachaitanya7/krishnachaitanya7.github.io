<p>arXiv:2411.13939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theory of unimodal maps perturbed by an heteroscedastic Markov chain noise and experiencing another heteroscedastic noise due to uncertain observation. We address and treat the filtering problem showing that by collecting more and more observations, one would predict the same distribution for the state of the underlying Markov chain no matter one's initial guess. Moreover we give other limit theorems, emphasizing in particular concentration inequalities and extreme value and Poisson distributions. Our results apply to a family of maps arising from a model of systemic risk in finance.</p>

<h2>A Copula-Based Approach to Modelling and Testing for Heavy-tailed Data with Bivariate Heteroscedastic Extremes</h2>

<p>arXiv:2411.15819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heteroscedasticity and correlated data pose challenges for extreme value analysis, particularly in two-sample testing problems for tail behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel copula-based multivariate model for independent but not identically distributed heavy-tailed data with heterogeneous marginal distributions and a varying copula structure. The proposed model encompasses classical models with independent and identically distributed data and some models with a mixture of correlation. To understand the tail behavior, we introduce the quasi-tail copula, which integrates both marginal heteroscedasticity and the dependence structure of the varying copula, and further propose the estimation approach. We then establish the joint asymptotic properties for the Hill estimator, scedasis functions, and quasi-tail copula. In addition, a multiplier bootstrap method is applied to estimate their complex covariance. Moreover, it is of practical interest to develop four typical two-sample testing problems under the new model, which include the equivalence of the extreme value indices and scedasis functions. Finally, we conduct simulation studies to validate our tests and apply the new model to the data from the stock market.</p>
