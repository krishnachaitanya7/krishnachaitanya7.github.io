<h2>Closer through commonality: Enhancing hypergraph contrastive learning with shared groups</h2>
<h3>Daeyoung Roh, Donghee Han, Daehee Kim, Keejun Han, Mun Yi</h3>
<p>arXiv:2502.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a superior modeling framework for representing complex multidimensional relationships in the context of real-world interactions that often occur in groups, overcoming the limitations of traditional homogeneous graphs. However, there have been few studies on hypergraphbased contrastive learning, and existing graph-based contrastive learning methods have not been able to fully exploit the highorder correlation information in hypergraphs. Here, we propose a Hypergraph Fine-grained contrastive learning (HyFi) method designed to exploit the complex high-dimensional information inherent in hypergraphs. While avoiding traditional graph augmentation methods that corrupt the hypergraph topology, the proposed method provides a simple and efficient learning augmentation function by adding noise to node features. Furthermore, we expands beyond the traditional dichotomous relationship between positive and negative samples in contrastive learning by introducing a new relationship of weak positives. It demonstrates the importance of fine-graining positive samples in contrastive learning. Therefore, HyFi is able to produce highquality embeddings, and outperforms both supervised and unsupervised baselines in average rank on node classification across 10 datasets. Our approach effectively exploits high-dimensional hypergraph information, shows significant improvement over existing graph-based contrastive learning methods, and is efficient in terms of training speed and GPU memory cost.

<h2>Differential equation and probability inspired graph neural networks for latent variable learning</h2>

<p>arXiv:2202.13800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic theory and differential equation are powerful tools for the interpretability and guidance of the design of machine learning models, especially for illuminating the mathematical motivation of learning latent variable from observation. Subspace learning maps high-dimensional features on low-dimensional subspace to capture efficient representation. Graphs are widely applied for modeling latent variable learning problems, and graph neural networks implement deep learning architectures on graphs. Inspired by probabilistic theory and differential equations, this paper conducts notes and proposals about graph neural networks to solve subspace learning problems by variational inference and differential equation.</p>

<h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Bipedal Locomotion: A Brief Survey</h2>
<h3>Lingfan Bao, Joseph Humphreys, Tianhu Peng, Chengxu Zhou</h3>
<p>arXiv:2404.17070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipedal robots are gaining global recognition due to their potential applications and advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). While DRL has significantly advanced bipedal locomotion, the development of a unified framework capable of handling a wide range of tasks remains an ongoing challenge. This survey systematically categorises, compares, and analyses existing DRL frameworks for bipedal locomotion, organising them into end-to-end and hierarchical control schemes. End-to-end frameworks are evaluated based on their learning approaches, while hierarchical frameworks are examined in terms of layered structures that integrate learning-based or traditional model-based methods. We provide a detailed evaluation of the composition, strengths, limitations, and capabilities of each framework. Additionally, this survey identifies key research gaps and proposes future directions aimed at creating a more integrated and efficient framework for bipedal locomotion, with wide-ranging applications in real-world environments.</p>

<h2>Uniform confidence bands for joint angles across different fatigue phases</h2>
<h3>Patrick Bastian, Rupsa Basu, Holger Dette</h3>
<p>arXiv:2502.08430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop uniform confidence bands for the mean function of stationary time series as a post-hoc analysis of multiple change point detection in functional time series. In particular, the methodology in this work provides bands for those segments where the jump size exceeds a certain threshold $\Delta$. In \cite{bastian2024multiplechangepointdetection} such exceedences of $\Delta$ were related to fatigue states of a running athlete. The extension to confidence bands stems from an interest in understanding the range of motion (ROM) of lower-extremity joints of running athletes under fatiguing conditions. From a biomechanical perspective, ROM serves as a proxy for joint flexibility under varying fatigue states, offering individualized insights into potentially problematic movement patterns. The new methodology provides a valuable tool for understanding the dynamic behavior of joint motion and its relationship to fatigue.</p>
