<h2>Exploring the Modular Integration of "AI + Architecture" Pedagogy in Undergraduate Design Education: A Case Study of Architectural Design III/IV Courses at Zhejiang University</h2>
<h3>Wang Jiaqi, Lan Yi, Chen Xiang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2512.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates AI integration in architectural education through a teaching experiment in Zhejiang University's 2024-25 grade three undergraduate design studio. Adopting a dual-module framework (20-hour AI training + embedded ethics discussions), the course introduced deep learning models, LLMs, AIGC, LoRA, and ComfyUI while maintaining the original curriculum structure, supported by dedicated technical instructors. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of phased guidance, balanced technical-ethical approaches, and institutional support. The model improved students' digital skills and strategic cognition while addressing AI ethics, providing a replicable approach combining technical and critical learning in design education.</p>

Abstract: The efficiency of water electrolysis in a photoelectrochemical cell is largely limited by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at its semiconductor photoanode. Reaction rate constants are key to investigating the slow kinetics of the multistep OER, as they indicate the rate-determining step. While these rate constants are usually calculated based on first-principles simulations, this research aims to estimate them from experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. Starting from a microkinetic model for charge transfer at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, an expression for the impedance as a function of the rate constants is derived. At lower potentials, the order of this impedance model is reduced, thus eliminating the rate constants corresponding to the last reaction steps. Moreover, it is shown that EIS data from at least two potentials needs to be combined in order to uniquely identify the rate constants of a particular reduced order model. Therefore, this work details a sample maximum likelihood estimator that integrates not only multiple frequencies, but also multiple potentials simultaneously. Measuring multiple periods of the current density and potential signals, allows this frequency domain estimator to take measurement uncertainty into account. In addition, due to the large numerical range of the rate constants, various scaling methods are implemented to achieve numerical stability. To find suitable initial values for the highly nonlinear optimization problem, different global estimation methods are compared. The complete estimation procedure of the rate constants is illustrated on simulated EIS data of a hematite photoanode.</p>

Abstract: Machine learning on graphs has recently achieved impressive progress in various domains, including molecular property prediction and chip design. However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance. See www.graphbench.io for further details.</p>

Abstract: Recent strides in video generation have paved the way for unified audio-visual generation. In this work, we present Seedance 1.5 pro, a foundational model engineered specifically for native, joint audio-video generation. Leveraging a dual-branch Diffusion Transformer architecture, the model integrates a cross-modal joint module with a specialized multi-stage data pipeline, achieving exceptional audio-visual synchronization and superior generation quality. To ensure practical utility, we implement meticulous post-training optimizations, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on high-quality datasets and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with multi-dimensional reward models. Furthermore, we introduce an acceleration framework that boosts inference speed by over 10X. Seedance 1.5 pro distinguishes itself through precise multilingual and dialect lip-syncing, dynamic cinematic camera control, and enhanced narrative coherence, positioning it as a robust engine for professional-grade content creation. Seedance 1.5 pro is now accessible on Volcano Engine at https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/experience/vision?type=GenVideo.</p>
