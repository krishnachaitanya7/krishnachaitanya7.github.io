<p>arXiv:2408.03108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, new representations of the Green's function for an acoustic d-dimensional half-space problem with impedance boundary conditions are presented. The main features of the new representation are: a) in addition to additive terms that appear also in the case of Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, the remaining part of the Green's function is factored into an oscillatory complex exponential function (with the product of the wavenumber and the eikonal as argument) and a remaining function which is slowly varying and hence allows for efficient polynomial approximation; b) the representation is given uniformly for all parameters by a single formula which consists of the product of two analytic functions.</p>

<h2>Leveraging multi-source and heterogeneous signals for fatigue detection</h2>

<p>arXiv:2507.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fatigue detection plays a critical role in safety-critical applications such as aviation, mining, and long-haul transport. However, most existing methods rely on high-end sensors and controlled environments, limiting their applicability in real world settings. This paper formally defines a practical yet underexplored problem setting for real world fatigue detection, where systems operating with context-appropriate sensors aim to leverage knowledge from differently instrumented sources including those using impractical sensors deployed in controlled environments. To tackle this challenge, we propose a heterogeneous and multi-source fatigue detection framework that adaptively utilizes the available modalities in the target domain while benefiting from the diverse configurations present in source domains. Our experiments, conducted using a realistic field-deployed sensor setup and two publicly available datasets, demonstrate the practicality, robustness, and improved generalization of our approach, paving the practical way for effective fatigue monitoring in sensor-constrained scenarios.</p>

<p>arXiv:2507.17325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of power electronic converter-interfaced distributed energy resources into modern power systems presents significant challenges for system monitoring, protection, and control. Grid impedance plays a critical role in the operation and stability assessment of grid-connected inverter systems. This study presents a real-time grid impedance estimation method based on the Discrete Fourier Transform. The proposed method is integrated with the Advanced Angle Estimation Kalman Filter using a Linear Quadratic Regulator current controller (AAEKF-LQR), assisting the use of impedance information for accurate instantaneous phase angle estimation. Simulation results confirm that the proposed impedance estimation method interacts effectively with the AAEKF-LQR controller, maintaining stable system performance under weak grid conditions. The approach also demonstrates the ability to deliver fast and accurate impedance estimation during operational variations in grid conditions, thereby supporting stable inverter operation.</p>
