<h2>Complex dynamics of a predator-prey model with constant-yield prey harvesting and Allee effect in predator</h2>
<h3>Jianhang Xie, Changrong Zhu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2504.00344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical behaviors of a Holling type I Leslie-Gower predator-prey model where the predator exhibits an Allee effect and is subjected to constant harvesting. The model demonstrates three types of equilibrium points under different parameter conditions, which could be either stable or unstable nodes (foci), saddle nodes, weak centers, or cusps. The system exhibits a saddle-node bifurcation near the saddle-node point and a Hopf bifurcation near the weak center. By calculating the first Lyapunov coefficient, the conditions for the occurrence of both supercritical and subcritical Hopf bifurcations are derived. Finally, it is proven that when the predator growth rate and the prey capture coefficient vary within a specific small neighborhood, the system undergoes a codimension-2 Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation near the cusp point.</p>

<h2>Form-Substance Discrimination: Concept, Cognition, and Pedagogy</h2>
<h3>Alexander M. Sidorkin</h3>
<p>arXiv:2504.00412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The skill to separate form from substance in writing has gained new prominence in the age of AI-generated content. The challenge - discriminating between fluent expression and substantive thought - constitutes a critical literacy skill for modern education. This paper examines form-substance discrimination (FSD) as an essential learning outcome for curriculum development in higher education. We analyze its cognitive foundations in fluency bias and inhibitory control, trace its evolution from composition theory concepts like "higher-order concerns," and explore how readers progress from novice acceptance of polished text to expert critical assessment. Drawing on research in cognitive psychology, composition studies, and emerging AI pedagogy, we propose practical strategies for fostering this ability through curriculum design, assessment practices, and explicit instruction. By prioritizing substance over surface in writing education, institutions can prepare students to navigate an information landscape where AI-generated content amplifies the ancient tension between style and meaning, ultimately safeguarding the value of authentic human thought in knowledge construction and communication.</p>

<h2>Learning Bipedal Locomotion on Gear-Driven Humanoid Robot Using Foot-Mounted IMUs</h2>
<h3>Sotaro Katayama, Yuta Koda, Norio Nagatsuka, Masaya Kinoshita</h3>
<p>arXiv:2504.00614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) for humanoid robots with high-gear ratio actuators remains challenging due to complex actuator dynamics and the absence of torque sensors. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework leveraging foot-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). Instead of pursuing detailed actuator modeling and system identification, we utilize foot-mounted IMU measurements to enhance rapid stabilization capabilities over challenging terrains. Additionally, we propose symmetric data augmentation dedicated to the proposed observation space and random network distillation to enhance bipedal locomotion learning over rough terrain. We validate our approach through hardware experiments on a miniature-sized humanoid EVAL-03 over a variety of environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method improves rapid stabilization capabilities over non-rigid surfaces and sudden environmental transitions.</p>
