<h2>Tunable Leg Stiffness in a Monopedal Hopper for Energy-Efficient Vertical Hopping Across Varying Ground Profiles</h2>
<h3>Rongqian Chen, Jun Kwon, Kefan Wu, Wei-Hsi Chen</h3>
<p>arXiv:2508.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable Stiffness for Terrain Adaptation), a vertical hopping robot with real-time tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides insights that could aid in the future development of controllers for selecting leg stiffness.</p>

<p>arXiv:2508.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the space of running gaits for the bipedal robot Cassie. Our first contribution is to present an approach for optimizing gait efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including starting and stopping from a standing position. We demonstrate this controller on hardware to establish the Guinness World Record for Fastest 100m by a Bipedal Robot.</p>

<h2>16 Ways to Gallop: Energetics and Body Dynamics of High-Speed Quadrupedal Gaits</h2>
<h3>Yasser G. Alqaham, Jing Cheng, Zhenyu Gan</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.13716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galloping is a common high-speed gait in both animals and quadrupedal robots, yet its energetic characteristics remain insufficiently explored. This study systematically analyzes a large number of possible galloping gaits by categorizing them based on the number of flight phases per stride and the phase relationships between the front and rear legs, following Hildebrand's framework for asymmetrical gaits. Using the A1 quadrupedal robot from Unitree, we model galloping dynamics as a hybrid dynamical system and employ trajectory optimization (TO) to minimize the cost of transport (CoT) across a range of speeds. Our results reveal that rotary and transverse gallop footfall sequences exhibit no fundamental energetic difference, despite variations in body yaw and roll motion. However, the number of flight phases significantly impacts energy efficiency: galloping with no flight phases is optimal at lower speeds, whereas galloping with two flight phases minimizes energy consumption at higher speeds. We validate these findings using a quadratic programming (QP)-based controller, developed in our previous work, in Gazebo simulations. These insights advance the understanding of quadrupedal locomotion energetics and may inform future legged robot designs for adaptive, energy-efficient gait transitions.</p>
