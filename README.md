<h2>The Influence of Exclusion Zones on the Coexistence of Predator and Prey with an Allee Effect</h2>
<h3>Henri Berestycki, William F. Fagan, Alex Safsten</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.21414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reaction--diffusion model of predator--prey interaction in which the predators occupy only a subset of the prey's territory, leaving a predator-free exclusion zone. Ecological examples include marine protected areas where it is illegal to fish, or buffer zones left between the territories of rival predators. The prey are subject to a strong Allee effect, so excessive predation may lead to the extinction of both species. The exclusion zone mitigates this problem by providing the prey with a refuge in which to proliferate without predation. Thus, paradoxically, a smaller predator territory may be able to support a more substantial population than a larger one. Using a topological degree argument, we show in any dimensions that, provided the exclusion zone is large enough, the system possesses spatially heterogeneous coexistence equilibria with positive populations of both species. This result is global in the sense that it does not rely on local bifurcations from semi-trivial stationary states. We also show that as the predator domain becomes asymptotically small, the total predator population does not vanish, and in some cases may actually be maximized in this limit of shrinking predation area. Conversely, we show that as the predator domain becomes large, it may exhibit thresholding behavior, passing suddenly from a regime with coexistence solutions to one in which extinction becomes unavoidable, highlighting the need for careful analysis in the management of predator--prey systems.</p>

<h2>Global Continuation of Stable Periodic Orbits in Systems of Competing Predators</h2>

<p>arXiv:2504.03058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a continuation technique to obtain global families of stable periodic orbits, delimited by transcritical bifurcations at both ends. To this end, we formulate a zero-finding problem whose zeros correspond to families of periodic orbits. We then define a Newton-like fixed-point operator and establish its contraction near a numerically computed approximation of the family. To verify the contraction, we derive sufficient conditions expressed as inequalities on the norms of the fixed-point operator, and involving the numerical approximation. These inequalities are then rigorously checked by the computer via interval arithmetic. To show the efficacy of our approach, we prove the existence of global families in an ecosystem with Holling's type II functional response, and thereby solve a stable connection problem proposed by Butler and Waltler in 1981. Our method does not rely on restricting the choice of parameters and is applicable to many other systems that numerically exhibit global families.</p>

<h2>Ikeda type lift on ${\rm SO}(3,n+1)$</h2>
<h3>Henry H. Kim, Takuya Yamauchi</h3>
<p>arXiv:2512.03412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using Ikeda's theory for a compatible family of Eisenstein series, we explicitly construct Ikeda type lifts on the special orthogonal group $G={\rm SO}(3,n+1)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with $n\ge 3$ which splits everywhere at finite places. Our lifts are Hecke eigen cusp forms of weight $l$ ($l\ge n+2$, even) and come from elliptic newforms with respect to ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ which are of weight $l-\frac{n-2}{2}$ when $n$ is even and $2l-n+1$ when $n$ is odd.The corresponding cuspidal automorphic representations are cohomological but non-tempered at any places including the infinity place.</p>

<h2>Asymmetry Demystified: Strict CLFs and Feedbacks for Predator-Prey Interconnections</h2>
<h3>Miroslav Krstic</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.21594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difficulty with control of population dynamics, besides the states being positive and the control having to also be positive, is the extreme difference in the dynamics near extinction and at overpopulated states. As hard as global stabilization is, even harder is finding CLFs that are strict, don't require LaSalle arguments, and permit quantification of convergence. Among the three canonical types of two-population dynamics (mutualism, which borders on trivial, predator-prey, and competition, which makes global stabilization with positive harvesting impossible), predator-prey is the ``sweet spot'' for the study of stabilization. Even when the predator-prey interaction is neutrally stable, global asymptotic stabilization with strict CLFs has proven very difficult, except by conservative, hard-to-gain-insight-from Matrosov-like techniques.
  In this little note we show directions for the design of clean, elegant, insight-bearing, majorization-free strict CLFs. They generalize the classical Volterra-style Lyapunov functions for population dynamics to non-separable Volterra-style constructions. As a bonus to strictification as an analysis activity, we provide examples of concurrent designs of feedback and CLFs, using customized versions of forwarding and backstepping (note that, in suitable coordinates, predator-prey is both strict-feedforward and strict-feedback), where the striking deviations from these methods' conventional forms is necessitated by the predator-prey's states and inputs needing to be kept positive.</p>

<h2>Jumping Control for a Quadrupedal Wheeled-Legged Robot via NMPC and DE Optimization</h2>
<h3>Xuanqi Zeng, Lingwei Zhang, Linzhu Yue, Zhitao Song, Hongbo Zhang, Tianlin Zhang, Yun-Hui Liu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.21612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadrupedal wheeled-legged robots combine the advantages of legged and wheeled locomotion to achieve superior mobility, but executing dynamic jumps remains a significant challenge due to the additional degrees of freedom introduced by wheeled legs. This paper develops a mini-sized wheeled-legged robot for agile motion and presents a novel motion control framework that integrates the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for locomotion and the Differential Evolution (DE) based trajectory optimization for jumping in quadrupedal wheeled-legged robots. The proposed controller utilizes wheel motion and locomotion to enhance jumping performance, achieving versatile maneuvers such as vertical jumping, forward jumping, and backflips. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the framework, demonstrating a forward jump over a 0.12 m obstacle and a vertical jump reaching 0.5 m.</p>
