Abstract: Physics-guided deep learning is an important prevalent research topic in scientific machine learning, which has tremendous potential in various complex applications including science and engineering. In these applications, data is expensive to acquire and high accuracy is required for making decisions. In this work, we introduce an efficient physics-guided deep learning framework for the variational modeling of nonlinear inverse problems, which is then applied to solve an electrical impedance tomography (EIT) inverse problem. The framework is achieved by unrolling the proposed Anderson accelerated Gauss-Newton (GNAA) algorithm into an end-to-end deep learning method. Firstly, we show the convergence of the GNAA algorithm in both cases: Anderson depth is equal to one and Anderson depth is greater than one. Then, we propose three types of strategies by combining the complementary strengths of GNAA and deep learning: GNAA of learned regularization (GNAA-LRNet), where the singular values of the regularization matrix are learned by a deep neural network; GNAA of learned proximity (GNAA-LPNet), where the regularization proximal operator is learned by using a deep neural network; GNAA of plug-and-play method (GNAA-PnPNet) where the regularization proximal operator is replaced by a pre-trained deep denoisers. Lastly, we present some numerical experiments to illustrate that the proposed approaches greatly improve the convergence rate and the quality of inverse solutions.</p>
