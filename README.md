<h2>16 Ways to Gallop: Energetics and Body Dynamics of High-Speed Quadrupedal Gaits</h2>

<p>arXiv:2503.13716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galloping is a common high-speed gait in both animals and quadrupedal robots, yet its energetic characteristics remain insufficiently explored. This study systematically analyzes a large number of possible galloping gaits by categorizing them based on the number of flight phases per stride and the phase relationships between the front and rear legs, following Hildebrand's framework for asymmetrical gaits. Using the A1 quadrupedal robot from Unitree, we model galloping dynamics as a hybrid dynamical system and employ trajectory optimization (TO) to minimize the cost of transport (CoT) across a range of speeds. Our results reveal that rotary and transverse gallop footfall sequences exhibit no fundamental energetic difference, despite variations in body yaw and roll motion. However, the number of flight phases significantly impacts energy efficiency: galloping with no flight phases is optimal at lower speeds, whereas galloping with two flight phases minimizes energy consumption at higher speeds. We validate these findings using a quadratic programming (QP)-based controller, developed in our previous work, in Gazebo simulations. These insights advance the understanding of quadrupedal locomotion energetics and may inform future legged robot designs for adaptive, energy-efficient gait transitions.</p>

<h2>Playful DoggyBot: Learning Agile and Precise Quadrupedal Locomotion</h2>

Abstract: Quadrupedal animals can perform agile and playful tasks while interacting with real-world objects. For instance, a trained dog can track and catch a flying frisbee before it touches the ground, while a cat left alone at home may leap to grasp the door handle. Successfully grasping an object during high-dynamic locomotion requires highly precise perception and control. However, due to hardware limitations, agility and precision are usually a trade-off in robotics problems. In this work, we employ a perception-control decoupled system based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), aiming to explore the level of precision a quadrupedal robot can achieve while interacting with objects during high-dynamic locomotion. Our experiments show that our quadrupedal robot, mounted with a passive gripper in front of the robot's chassis, can perform both tracking and catching tasks similar to a real trained dog. The robot can follow a mid-air ball moving at speeds of up to 3m/s and it can leap and successfully catch a small object hanging above it at a height of 1.05m in simulation and 0.8m in the real world.</p>

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)-inspired tactile sensors are gaining attention in robotic tactile sensing due to their cost-effectiveness, safety, and scalability with sparse electrode configurations. This paper presents a data augmentation strategy for learning-based tactile reconstruction that amplifies the original single-frame signal measurement into 32 distinct, effective signal data for training. This approach supplements uncollected conditions of position information, resulting in more accurate and high-resolution tactile reconstructions. Data augmentation for EIT significantly reduces the required EIT measurements and achieves promising performance with even limited samples. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the correlation coefficient by over 12% and reduces the relative error by over 21% under various noise levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a standard deep neural network (DNN) utilizing the proposed data augmentation reduces the required data down to 1/31 while achieving a similar tactile reconstruction quality. Real-world tests further validate the approach's effectiveness on a flexible EIT-based tactile sensor. These results could help address the challenge of training tactile sensing networks with limited available measurements, improving the accuracy and applicability of EIT-based tactile sensing systems.</p>
