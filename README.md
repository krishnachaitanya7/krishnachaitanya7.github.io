Abstract: Achieving stable bipedal walking on surfaces with unknown motion remains a challenging control problem due to the hybrid, time-varying, partially unknown dynamics of the robot and the difficulty of accurate state and surface motion estimation. Surface motion imposes uncertainty on both system parameters and non-homogeneous disturbance in the walking robot dynamics. In this paper, we design an adaptive ankle torque controller to simultaneously address these two uncertainties and propose a step-length planner to minimize the required control torque. Typically, an adaptive controller is used for a continuous system. To apply adaptive control on a hybrid system such as a walking robot, an intermediate command profile is introduced to ensure a continuous error system. Simulations on a planar bipedal robot, along with comparisons against a baseline controller, demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively ensures stable walking and accurate tracking under unknown, time-varying disturbances.</p>
