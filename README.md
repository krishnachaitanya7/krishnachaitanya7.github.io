<h2>Euclidean Distance Deflation Under High-Dimensional Heteroskedastic Noise</h2>

<p>arXiv:2507.18520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation is a fundamental step in many machine learning and data analysis algorithms. In real-world applications, however, these distances are frequently distorted by heteroskedastic noise$\unicode{x2014}$a prevalent form of inhomogeneous corruption characterized by variable noise magnitudes across data observations. Such noise inflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to misrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address the tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior knowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be performed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably. Specifically, we develop a principled, hyperparameter-free approach that jointly estimates the noise magnitudes and corrects the distances. We provide theoretical guarantees for our approach, establishing probabilistic bounds on the estimation errors of both noise magnitudes and distances. These bounds, measured in the normalized $\ell_1$ norm, converge to zero at polynomial rates as both feature dimension and dataset size increase. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method accurately estimates distances in challenging regimes, significantly improving the robustness of subsequent distance-based computations. Notably, when applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data, our method yields noise magnitude estimates consistent with an established prototypical model, enabling accurate nearest neighbor identification that is fundamental to many downstream analyses.</p>

<h2>In situ estimation of the acoustic surface impedance using simulation-based inference</h2>

<p>arXiv:2509.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate acoustic simulations of enclosed spaces require precise boundary conditions, typically expressed through surface impedances for wave-based methods. Conventional measurement techniques often rely on simplifying assumptions about the sound field and mounting conditions, limiting their validity for real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a Bayesian framework for the in situ estimation of frequency-dependent acoustic surface impedances from sparse interior sound pressure measurements. The approach employs simulation-based inference, which leverages the expressiveness of modern neural network architectures to directly map simulated data to posterior distributions of model parameters, bypassing conventional sampling-based Bayesian approaches and offering advantages for high-dimensional inference problems. Impedance behavior is modeled using a damped oscillator model extended with a fractional calculus term. The framework is verified on a finite element model of a cuboid room and further tested with impedance tube measurements used as reference, achieving robust and accurate estimation of all six individual impedances. Application to a numerical car cabin model further demonstrates reliable uncertainty quantification and high predictive accuracy even for complex-shaped geometries. Posterior predictive checks and coverage diagnostics confirm well-calibrated inference, highlighting the method's potential for generalizable, efficient, and physically consistent characterization of acoustic boundary conditions in real-world interior environments.</p>

<h2>LIPM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Stable and Perceptive Locomotion in Bipedal Robots</h2>
<h3>Haokai Su, Haoxiang Luo, Shunpeng Yang, Kaiwen Jiang, Wei Zhang, Hua Chen</h3>
<p>arXiv:2509.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.</p>

<h2>Short-term cognitive fatigue of spatial selective attention after face-to-face conversations in virtual noisy environments</h2>
<h3>\v{L}ubo\v{s} Hl\'adek, Piotr Majdak, Robert Baumgartner</h3>
<p>arXiv:2509.09479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial selective attention is an important asset for communication in cocktail party situations but may be compromised by short-term cognitive fatigue. Here we tested whether an effortful conversation in a highly ecological setting depletes task performance in an auditory spatial selective attention task. Young participants with normal hearing performed the task before and after (1) having a real dyadic face-to-face conversation on a free topic in a virtual reverberant room with simulated interfering conversations and background babble noise at 72 dB SPL for 30 minutes, (2) passively listening to the interfering conversations and babble noise, or (3) having the conversation in quiet. Self-reported perceived effort and fatigue increased after conversations in noise and passive listening relative to the reports after conversations in quiet. In contrast to our expectations, response times in the attention task decreased, rather than increased, after conversation in noise and accuracy did not change systematically in any of the conditions on the group level. Unexpectedly, we observed strong training effects between the individual sessions in our within-subject design even after one hour of training on a different day.</p>
