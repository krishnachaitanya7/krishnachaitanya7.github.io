<h2>Bifurcation Analysis of Predator-Prey System using Conformable Fractional Order Discretization</h2>
<h3>Muhammad Rafaqat, Abubakar Masha, Nauman Ahmed, Ali Raza, Wojciech Sumelka</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, conformal fractional order discretization [31, 35, 36] is used to analyze bifurcation analysis and stability of a predator-prey system. A continuous model has been discretized into a discrete one while preserving the fractional-order dynamics. This allows us to look more closely at the stability properties of the system and bifurcation phenomena, including period-doubling and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Through numerical and theoretical methods, this research investigated how the modification in system parameters affects the overall dynamics, which may have implications for ecological management and conservation strategies.</p>

<p>arXiv:2501.00762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable empirical success in processing and representing graph-structured data across various domains. However, a significant challenge known as "oversmoothing" persists, where vertex features become nearly indistinguishable in deep GNNs, severely restricting their expressive power and practical utility. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic oversmoothing rates of deep GNNs with and without residual connections by deriving explicit convergence rates for a normalized vertex similarity measure. Our analytical framework is grounded in the multiplicative ergodic theorem. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adding residual connections effectively mitigates or prevents oversmoothing across several broad families of parameter distributions. The theoretical findings are strongly supported by numerical experiments.</p>

<h2>Identifying Surgical Instruments in Pedagogical Cataract Surgery Videos through an Optimized Aggregation Network</h2>
<h3>Sanya Sinha, Michal Balazia, Francois Bremond</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.02618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instructional cataract surgery videos are crucial for ophthalmologists and trainees to observe surgical details repeatedly. This paper presents a deep learning model for real-time identification of surgical instruments in these videos, using a custom dataset scraped from open-access sources. Inspired by the architecture of YOLOV9, the model employs a Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) mechanism and a novel Generally-Optimized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (Go-ELAN) to address the information bottleneck problem, enhancing Minimum Average Precision (mAP) at higher Non-Maximum Suppression Intersection over Union (NMS IoU) scores. The Go-ELAN YOLOV9 model, evaluated against YOLO v5, v7, v8, v9 vanilla, Laptool and DETR, achieves a superior mAP of 73.74 at IoU 0.5 on a dataset of 615 images with 10 instrument classes, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p>
