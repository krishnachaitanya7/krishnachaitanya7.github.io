Abstract: Computational music research plays a critical role in advancing music production, distribution, and understanding across various musical styles worldwide. Despite the immense cultural and religious significance, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (EOTC) chants are relatively underrepresented in computational music research. This paper contributes to this field by introducing a new dataset specifically tailored for analyzing EOTC chants, also known as Yaredawi Zema. This work provides a comprehensive overview of a 10-hour dataset, 369 instances, creation, and curation process, including rigorous quality assurance measures. Our dataset has a detailed word-level temporal boundary and reading tone annotation along with the corresponding chanting mode label of audios. Moreover, we have also identified the chanting options associated with multiple chanting notations in the manuscript by annotating them accordingly. Our goal in making this dataset available to the public 1 is to encourage more research and study of EOTC chants, including lyrics transcription, lyric-to-audio alignment, and music generation tasks. Such research work will advance knowledge and efforts to preserve this distinctive liturgical music, a priceless cultural artifact for the Ethiopian people.</p>

Abstract: Despite its musicological, cultural, and religious significance, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (EOTC) chant is relatively underrepresented in music research. Historical records, including manuscripts, research papers, and oral traditions, confirm Saint Yared's establishment of three canonical EOTC chanting modes during the 6th century. This paper attempts to investigate the EOTC chants using music information retrieval (MIR) techniques. Among the research questions regarding the analysis and understanding of EOTC chants, Yaredawi YeZema Silt, namely the mode of chanting adhering to Saint Yared's standards, is of primary importance. Therefore, we consider the task of Yaredawi YeZema Silt classification in EOTC chants by introducing a new dataset and showcasing a series of classification experiments for this task. Results show that using the distribution of stabilized pitch contours as the feature representation on a simple neural network-based classifier becomes an effective solution. The musicological implications and insights of such results are further discussed through a comparative study with the previous ethnomusicology literature on EOTC chants. By making this dataset publicly accessible, we aim to promote future exploration and analysis of EOTC chants and highlight potential directions for further research, thereby fostering a deeper understanding and preservation of this unique spiritual and cultural heritage.</p>

<h2>Asynchronous Telegate and Teledata Protocols for Distributed Quantum Computing</h2>

<p>arXiv:2407.14987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cost of distributed quantum operations such as the telegate and teledata protocols is high due to latencies from distributing entangled photons and classical information. This paper proposes an extension to the telegate and teledata protocols to allow for asynchronous classical communication which hides the cost of distributed quantum operations. We then discuss the benefits and limitations of these asynchronous protocols and propose a potential way to improve these asynchronous protocols using nonunitary operators. Finally, a quantum network card is described as an example of how asynchronous quantum operations might be used.</p>
