<p>arXiv:2601.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among populations with limited literacy in emerging digital markets, the adoption of mobile phones, combined with comprehension barriers and poor cybersecurity hygiene, has created hidden privacy risks. This paper examines how informed consent is often abused by predatory financial applications, leading to financial scams that disproportionately affect users with low literacy. We focus on predatory loan, gambling, and trading apps, analyzing a dataset of 50 Google Play Store apps to measure how many omit or obfuscate critical privacy disclosures. We also evaluate comprehension gaps among users with low literacy via a targeted user study and assess whether Large Language Model (LLM)-generated summaries, translations, and visual cues can improve consent clarity. Our findings show that 85% of study participants did not understand basic app permissions, underscoring the urgent need for stronger regulatory oversight and scalable LLM-driven privacy-literacy tools.</p>

<h2>Co-Designing Digital Humans for Online Learning: A Framework for Human-AI Pedagogical Integration</h2>
<h3>Xiaokang Lei, Ching Christie Pang, Yuyang Jiang, Xin Tong, Pan Hui</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.17434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) are reshaping education, with virtual avatars emerging as digital teachers capable of enhancing engagement, sustaining attention, and addressing instructor shortages. Aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for equitable quality education, these technologies hold promise yet lack clear guidelines for effective design and implementation in online learning. To fill this gap, we introduce a framework specifying when, what, and how digital teachers should be integrated. Our study combines (1) a design space analysis of 87 works across AI, educational technology, design, and HCI, (2) a survey of 132 learners' practices and preferences, and (3) three co-design workshops with 18 experts from pedagogy, design, and AI. It provides actionable guidance for educators, designers, and HCI researchers, advancing opportunities to build more engaging, equitable, and effective online learning environments powered by digital teachers.</p>

<h2>Kolmogorov-Arnold graph neural networks for chemically informed prediction tasks on inorganic nanomaterials</h2>

<p>arXiv:2512.19494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent development of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) has found its application in the field of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) particularly in molecular data modeling and potential drug discovery. Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks (KAGNNs) expand on the existing set of GNN models with KAN-based counterparts. KAGNNs have been demonstrably successful in surpassing the accuracy of MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)-based GNNs in the task of molecular property prediction. These models were widely tested on the graph datasets consisting of organic molecules. In this study, we explore the application of KAGNNs towards inorganic nanomaterials. In 2024, a large scale inorganic nanomaterials dataset was published under the title CHILI (Chemically-Informed Large-scale Inorganic Nanomaterials Dataset), and various MLP-based GNNs have been tested on this dataset. We adapt and test our own KAGNNs appropriate for eight defined tasks. Our experiments reveal that, KAGNNs frequently surpass the performance of their counterpart GNNs. Most notably, on crystal system and space group classification tasks in CHILI-3K, KAGNNs achieve the new state-of-the-art results of 99.5 percent and 96.6 percent accuracy, respectively, compared to the previous 65.7 and 73.3 percent each.</p>

<h2>Prediction of Cellular Malignancy Using Electrical Impedance Signatures and Supervised Machine Learning</h2>

<p>arXiv:2601.04478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bioelectrical properties of cells such as relative permittivity, conductivity, and characteristic time constants vary significantly between healthy and malignant cells across different frequencies. These distinctions provide a promising foundation for diagnostic and classification applications. This study systematically reviewed 33 scholarly articles to compile datasets of quantitative bioelectric parameters and evaluated their utility in predictive modeling. Three supervised machine learning algorithms- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were implemented and tuned using key hyperparameters to assess classification performance. Model effectiveness was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics. Results demonstrate that Random Forest achieved the highest predictive accuracy of ~ 90% when configured with a maximum depth of 4 and 100 estimators. These findings highlight the potential of integrating bioelectrical property analysis with machine learning for improved diagnostic decision-making. Similarly, for KNN and SVM, the F1 score peaked at approximately 78% and 76.5%, respectively. Future work will explore incorporating additional discriminative features, leveraging stimulated datasets, and optimizing hyperparameter through advanced search strategies. Ultimately, hardware prototype with embedded micro-electrodes and real-time control systems could pave the path for practical diagnostic tools capable of in-situ cell classification.</p>

<h2>A penalized heteroskedastic ordered probit model for DIF (measurement invariance) testing of single-item assessments in cross-cultural research</h2>
<h3>R Noah Padgett</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.18889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential item functioning (DIF) or measurement invariance (MI) testing for single-item assessments has previously been impossible. Part of the issue is that there are no conditioning variables to serve as a proxy for the latent variable--regression-based DIF methods. Another reason is that factor-analytic approaches require multiple items to estimate parameters. In this technical working paper, I propose an approach for evaluating DIF/MI in a single-item assessment of a construct. The current methods should NOT replace using multiple-indicator MG-CFA/IRT analyses of DIF/MI or regression mased methods when possible. More items generally provide significantly better construct coverage and provide more rigorous DIF/MI evaluation.</p>
