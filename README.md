<h2>Robust Bayesian estimation in conditionally heteroscedastic time series models</h2>
<h3>Jeongho Lee, Junmo Song</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.06360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outliers can seriously distort statistical inference by inducing excessive sensitivity in the likelihood function, thereby compromising the reliability of Bayesian estimation. To address this issue, we develop a robust Bayesian estimation method for conditionally heteroscedastic time series models by extending the density power divergence (DPD) framework to the Bayesian setting. The resulting DPD-based posterior distribution, controlled by a tuning parameter, achieves a smooth balance between efficiency and robustness. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator; specifically, the DPD-based posterior is shown to satisfy a Bernstein-von Mises type theorem, converging to a normal distribution centered at the minimum DPD estimator (MDPDE). Furthermore, the corresponding Bayes estimator, defined as the posterior mean under the DPD-based posterior (EDPE), is asymptotically equivalent to the MDPDE. Monte Carlo simulations based on GARCH(1,1) models confirm that the proposed EDPE performs well under both uncontaminated and contaminated data, maintaining robustness where the ordinary Bayes estimator becomes severely biased. An empirical application to BTC-USD returns further demonstrates the practical advantages of the proposed robust Bayesian framework for financial time series analysis.</p>

<p>arXiv:2602.06917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of machine learning in audio analysis has opened new possibilities for technology-enhanced music education. This paper introduces a framework for automatic singing mistake detection in the context of music pedagogy, supported by a newly curated dataset. The dataset comprises synchronized teacher learner vocal recordings, with annotations marking different types of mistakes made by learners. Using this dataset, we develop different deep learning models for mistake detection and benchmark them. To compare the efficacy of mistake detection systems, a new evaluation methodology is proposed. Experiments indicate that the proposed learning-based methods are superior to rule-based methods. A systematic study of errors and a cross-teacher study reveal insights into music pedagogy that can be utilised for various music applications. This work sets out new directions of research in music pedagogy. The codes and dataset are publicly available.</p>

<h2>Predicting the fatigue life of asphalt concrete using neural networks</h2>
<h3>Jakub Houl\'ik, Jan Valentin, V\'aclav Ne\v{z}erka</h3>
<p>arXiv:2406.01523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asphalt concrete's (AC) durability and maintenance demands are strongly influenced by its fatigue life. Traditional methods for determining this characteristic are both resource-intensive and time-consuming. This study employs artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict AC fatigue life, focusing on the impact of strain level, binder content, and air-void content. Leveraging a substantial dataset, we tailored our models to effectively handle the wide range of fatigue life data, typically represented on a logarithmic scale. The mean square logarithmic error was utilized as the loss function to enhance prediction accuracy across all levels of fatigue life. Through comparative analysis of various hyperparameters, we developed a machine-learning model that captures the complex relationships within the data. Our findings demonstrate that higher binder content significantly enhances fatigue life, while the influence of air-void content is more variable, depending on binder levels. Most importantly, this study provides insights into the intricacies of using ANNs for modeling, showcasing their potential utility with larger datasets. The codes developed and the data used in this study are provided as open source on a GitHub repository, with a link included in the paper for full access.</p>
