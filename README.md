<h2>Transmutation operators for Schr\"odinger equations with distributional potentials and the associated impedance equation</h2>
<h3>V\'ictor A. Vicente-Ben\'itez</h3>
<p>arXiv:2511.12094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the construction of an integral transmutation operator for the Schr\"odinger equation
  \[
  -y'' + q(x)y = \lambda y, \quad x \in J, \ \lambda \in \mathbb{C},
  \] in the case where $q$ is the distributional derivative of an $L^2$ function on a bounded interval $J \subset \mathbb{R}$. Such a transmutation operator transforms solutions of $ v'' + \lambda v = 0 $ into solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. The construction of the integral transmutation operator relies on a new regularization of the distributional Schr\"odinger equation based on the Polya factorization in terms of a solution $f$ that does not vanish on the closure of $J$. Sufficient conditions for the existence of such a function $f$ are established, together with a method for its construction.
  As a consequence of the Polya factorization, we obtain an integro-differential transmutation operator for the associated Sturm--Liouville operator in impedance form related to $f$, along with smoothness conditions for the transmutation kernel. Furthermore, we introduce the Darboux transform for both the Schr\"odinger and impedance operators, and describe their relationships with the corresponding transmutation operators. Finally, we develop several series representations for the solutions, including the spectral parameter power series and the Neumann series of spherical Bessel functions.</p>

<h2>Variable Impedance Control for Floating-Base Supernumerary Robotic Leg in Walking Assistance</h2>
<h3>Jun Huo, Kehan Xu, Chengyao Li, Yu Cao, Jie Zuo, Xinxing Chen, Jian Huang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2511.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In human-robot systems, ensuring safety during force control in the presence of both internal and external disturbances is crucial. As a typical loosely coupled floating-base robot system, the supernumerary robotic leg (SRL) system is particularly susceptible to strong internal disturbances. To address the challenge posed by floating base, we investigated the dynamics model of the loosely coupled SRL and designed a hybrid position/force impedance controller to fit dynamic torque input. An efficient variable impedance control (VIC) method is developed to enhance human-robot interaction, particularly in scenarios involving external force disturbances. By dynamically adjusting impedance parameters, VIC improves the dynamic switching between rigidity and flexibility, so that it can adapt to unknown environmental disturbances in different states. An efficient real-time stability guaranteed impedance parameters generating network is specifically designed for the proposed SRL, to achieve shock mitigation and high rigidity supporting. Simulations and experiments validate the system's effectiveness, demonstrating its ability to maintain smooth signal transitions in flexible states while providing strong support forces in rigid states. This approach provides a practical solution for accommodating individual gait variations in interaction, and significantly advances the safety and adaptability of human-robot systems.</p>

<h2>Medal S: Spatio-Textual Prompt Model for Medical Segmentation</h2>
<h3>Pengcheng Shi, Jiawei Chen, Jiaqi Liu, Xinglin Zhang, Tao Chen, Lei Li</h3>
<p>arXiv:2511.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Medal S, a medical segmentation foundation model that supports native-resolution spatial and textual prompts within an end-to-end trainable framework. Unlike text-only methods lacking spatial awareness, Medal S achieves channel-wise alignment between volumetric prompts and text embeddings, mitigating inaccuracies from resolution mismatches. By preserving full 3D context, it efficiently processes multiple native-resolution masks in parallel, enhancing multi-class segmentation performance. A lightweight 3D convolutional module enables precise voxel-space refinement guided by both prompt types, supporting up to 243 classes across CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and microscopy modalities in the BiomedSegFM dataset. Medal S offers two prompting modes: a text-only mode, where model predictions serve as spatial prompts for self-refinement without human input, and a hybrid mode, incorporating manual annotations for enhanced flexibility. For 24-class segmentation, parallel spatial prompting reduces inference time by more than 90% compared to sequential prompting. We propose dynamic resampling to address target-patch ratio imbalance, extending SAT and nnU-Net for data augmentation. Furthermore, we develop optimized text preprocessing, a two-stage inference strategy, and post-processing techniques to improve memory efficiency, precision, and inference speed. On the five-modality average on the validation set, Medal S outperforms SAT with a DSC of 75.44 (vs. 69.83), NSD of 77.34 (vs. 71.06), F1 of 38.24 (vs. 24.88), and DSC TP of 65.46 (vs. 46.97). Medal S achieves excellent performance by harmonizing spatial precision with semantic textual guidance, demonstrating superior efficiency and accuracy in multi-class medical segmentation tasks compared to sequential prompt-based approaches. Medal S will be publicly available at https://github.com/yinghemedical/Medal-S.</p>

<h2>Warm-starting active-set solvers using graph neural networks</h2>
<h3>Ella J. Schmidtobreick, Daniel Arnstr\"om, Paul H\"ausner, Jens Sj\"olund</h3>
<p>arXiv:2511.13174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic programming (QP) solvers are widely used in real-time control and optimization, but their computational cost often limits applicability in time-critical settings. We propose a learning-to-optimize approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict active sets in the dual active-set solver DAQP. The method exploits the structural properties of QPs by representing them as bipartite graphs and learning to identify the optimal active set for efficiently warm-starting the solver. Across varying problem sizes, the GNN consistently reduces the number of solver iterations compared to cold-starting, while performance is comparable to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) baseline. Furthermore, a GNN trained on varying problem sizes generalizes effectively to unseen dimensions, demonstrating flexibility and scalability. These results highlight the potential of structure-aware learning to accelerate optimization in real-time applications such as model predictive control.</p>

<h2>Making Evidence Actionable in Adaptive Learning Closing the Diagnostic Pedagogical Loop</h2>
<h3>Amirreza Mehrabi, Jason Wade Morphew, Breejha Quezada, N. Sanjay Rebello</h3>
<p>arXiv:2511.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, producing help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted microinterventions. The adaptive learning algorithm includes three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted limit for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formulate intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows derived from ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy with diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency settings, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid switches along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with 1204 students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for nearly all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by about 12 percentage points relative to greedy and produced more consistent difficulty alignment, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy at lower computational cost in resource-scarce environments. Slack variables localized missing content and guided targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across student subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic pedagogical loop and enables equitable, load-aware personalization at the classroom scale.</p>
