<h2>Ekedahl-Oort types of stable curves</h2>

<p>arXiv:2307.13445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Moonen's definition of Ekedahl-Oort types of smooth curves in terms of Hasse-Witt triples to all stable curves and show that it matches Ekedahl and van der Geer's definition of Ekedahl-Oort types of their generalized Jacobians as semi-abelian varieties. Using this intrinsic insight, we can compute the dimensions of certain Ekedahl-Oort loci of curves and generalize some previously known results about the dimensions of the $p$-rank and $a$-number loci of curves.</p>

<h2>Who You Explain To Matters: Learning by Explaining to Conversational Agents with Different Pedagogical Roles</h2>
<h3>Zhengtao Xu, Junti Zhang, Anthony Tang, Yi-Chieh Lee</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational agents are increasingly used in education for learning support. An application is "learning by explaining", where learners explain their understanding to an agent. However, existing research focuses on single roles, leaving it unclear how different pedagogical roles influence learners' interaction patterns, learning outcomes and experiences. We conducted a between-subjects study (N=96) comparing agents with three pedagogical roles (Tutee, Peer, Challenger) and a control condition while learning an economics concept. We found that different pedagogical roles shaped learning dynamics, including interaction patterns and experiences. Specifically, the Tutee agent elicited the most cognitive investment but led to high pressure. The Peer agent fostered high absorption and interest through collaborative dialogue. The Challenger agent promoted cognitive and metacognitive acts, enhancing critical thinking with moderate pressure. The findings highlight how agent roles shape different learning dynamics, guiding the design of educational agents tailored to specific pedagogical goals and learning phases.</p>

<h2>From Neck to Head: Bio-Impedance Sensing for Head Pose Estimation</h2>
<h3>Mengxi Liu, Lala Shakti Swarup Ray, Sizhen Bian, Ko Watanabe, Ankur Bhatt, Joanna Sorysz, Russel Torah, Bo Zhou, Paul Lukowicz</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.12884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors, including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA vision-based methods.</p>
