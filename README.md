Abstract: With the widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in domains like military reconnaissance, emergency rescue, and logistics delivery, efficiently planning the shortest flight path has become a critical challenge. Traditional heuristic-based methods often suffer from the inability to escape from local optima, which limits their effectiveness in finding the shortest path. To address these issues, a novel Improved Grey Wolf Optimizer (IGWO) is presented in this study. The proposed IGWO incorporates an Advanced Cooperative Predation (ACP) and a Lens Opposition-based Learning Strategy (LOBL) in order to improve the optimization capability of the method. Simulation results show that IGWO ranks first in optimization performance on benchmark functions F1-F5, F7, and F9-F12, outperforming all other compared algorithms. Subsequently, IGWO is applied to UAV shortest path planning in various obstacle-laden environments. Simulation results show that the paths planned by IGWO are, on average, shorter than those planned by GWO, PSO, and WOA by 1.70m, 1.68m, and 2.00m, respectively, across four different maps.</p>

Abstract: Visuals are valuable tools for teaching math word problems (MWPs), helping young learners interpret textual descriptions into mathematical expressions before solving them. However, creating such visuals is labor-intensive and there is a lack of automated methods to support this process. In this paper, we present Math2Visual, an automatic framework for generating pedagogically meaningful visuals from MWP text descriptions. Math2Visual leverages a pre-defined visual language and a design space grounded in interviews with math teachers, to illustrate the core mathematical relationships in MWPs. Using Math2Visual, we construct an annotated dataset of 1,903 visuals and evaluate Text-to-Image (TTI) models for their ability to generate visuals that align with our design. We further fine-tune several TTI models with our dataset, demonstrating improvements in educational visual generation. Our work establishes a new benchmark for automated generation of pedagogically meaningful visuals and offers insights into key challenges in producing multimodal educational content, such as the misrepresentation of mathematical relationships and the omission of essential visual elements.</p>
