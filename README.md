<p>arXiv:2503.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructions and exploration of plane algebraic curves has received a new push with the development of automated methods, whose algorithms are continuously improved and implemented in various software packages. We use them to explore the pedal curves of conics. This provides a construction of interesting geometric loci, given at first by parametric representations. After implicitization, they appear as sextics, octics and other curves of higher degree. We explore their irreducibility and their singular points (crunodes, cusps, etc.).</p>

<h2>Safety-Critical and Distributed Nonlinear Predictive Controllers for Teams of Quadrupedal Robots</h2>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hierarchical, safety-critical control framework that integrates distributed nonlinear model predictive controllers (DNMPCs) with control barrier functions (CBFs) to enable cooperative locomotion of multi-agent quadrupedal robots in complex environments. While NMPC-based methods are widely adopted for enforcing safety constraints and navigating multi-robot systems (MRSs) through intricate environments, ensuring the safety of MRSs requires a formal definition grounded in the concept of invariant sets. CBFs, typically implemented via quadratic programs (QPs) at the planning layer, provide formal safety guarantees. However, their zero-control horizon limits their effectiveness for extended trajectory planning in inherently unstable, underactuated, and nonlinear legged robot models. Furthermore, the integration of CBFs into real-time NMPC for sophisticated MRSs, such as quadrupedal robot teams, remains underexplored. This paper develops computationally efficient, distributed NMPC algorithms that incorporate CBF-based collision safety guarantees within a consensus protocol, enabling longer planning horizons for safe cooperative locomotion under disturbances and rough terrain conditions. The optimal trajectories generated by the DNMPCs are tracked using full-order, nonlinear whole-body controllers at the low level. The proposed approach is validated through extensive numerical simulations with up to four Unitree A1 robots and hardware experiments involving two A1 robots subjected to external pushes, rough terrain, and uncertain obstacle information. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed CBF-based DNMPCs achieve a 27.89% higher success rate than conventional NMPCs without CBF constraints.</p>

<h2>Long-horizon Locomotion and Manipulation on a Quadrupedal Robot with Large Language Models</h2>

<p>arXiv:2404.05291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a large language model (LLM) based system to empower quadrupedal robots with problem-solving abilities for long-horizon tasks beyond short-term motions. Long-horizon tasks for quadrupeds are challenging since they require both a high-level understanding of the semantics of the problem for task planning and a broad range of locomotion and manipulation skills to interact with the environment. Our system builds a high-level reasoning layer with large language models, which generates hybrid discrete-continuous plans as robot code from task descriptions. It comprises multiple LLM agents: a semantic planner that sketches a plan, a parameter calculator that predicts arguments in the plan, a code generator that converts the plan into executable robot code, and a replanner that handles execution failures or human interventions. At the low level, we adopt reinforcement learning to train a set of motion planning and control skills to unleash the flexibility of quadrupeds for rich environment interactions. Our system is tested on long-horizon tasks that are infeasible to complete with one single skill. Simulation and real-world experiments show that it successfully figures out multi-step strategies and demonstrates non-trivial behaviors, including building tools or notifying a human for help. Demos are available on our project page: https://sites.google.com/view/long-horizon-robot.</p>

<h2>Towards the Pedagogical Steering of Large Language Models for Tutoring: A Case Study with Modeling Productive Failure</h2>

Abstract: One-to-one tutoring is one of the most efficient methods of teaching. With the growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been efforts to create LLM based conversational tutors which can expand the benefits of one to one tutoring to everyone. However, current LLMs are trained primarily to be helpful assistants and lack crucial pedagogical skills. For example, they often quickly reveal the solution to the student and fail to plan for a richer multi turn pedagogical interaction. To use LLMs in pedagogical settings, they need to be steered to use effective teaching strategies: a problem we introduce as Pedagogical Steering. We develop StratL, an algorithm to optimize LLM prompts and steer it to follow a predefined multi-turn tutoring plan represented as a transition graph. As a case study, we create a prototype tutor for high school math following Productive Failure (PF), an advanced and effective learning design. To validate our approach in a real-world setting, we run a field study with 17 high school students in Singapore and show that StratL succeeds in steering the LLM to follow the PF tutoring strategy. Finally, we highlight challenges in Pedagogical Steering of LLMs and offer opportunities for further improvements by publishing a dataset of PF problems and our code.</p>
