<h2>Towards Pedagogical LLMs with Supervised Fine Tuning for Computing Education</h2>
<h3>Alexandra Vassar, Jake Renzella, Emily Ross, Andrew Taylor</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.01765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates supervised fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) to improve their pedagogical alignment in computing education, addressing concerns that LLMs may hinder learning outcomes. The project utilised a proprietary dataset of 2,500 high quality question/answer pairs from programming course forums, and explores two research questions: the suitability of university course forums in contributing to fine-tuning datasets, and how supervised fine-tuning can improve LLMs' alignment with educational principles such as constructivism. Initial findings suggest benefits in pedagogical alignment of LLMs, with deeper evaluations required.</p>

<h2>Silver medal Solution for Image Matching Challenge 2024</h2>
<h3>Yian Wang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Matching Challenge 2024 is a competition focused on building 3D maps from diverse image sets, requiring participants to solve fundamental computer vision challenges in image matching across varying angles, lighting, and seasonal changes. This project develops a Pipeline method that combines multiple advanced techniques: using pre-trained EfficientNet-B7 for initial feature extraction and cosine distance-based image pair filtering, employing both KeyNetAffNetHardNet and SuperPoint for keypoint feature extraction, utilizing AdaLAM and SuperGlue for keypoint matching, and finally applying Pycolmap for 3D spatial analysis. The methodology achieved an excellent score of 0.167 on the private leaderboard, with experimental results demonstrating that the combination of KeyNetAffNetHardNet and SuperPoint provides significant advantages in keypoint detection and matching, particularly when dealing with challenging variations in surface texture and environmental conditions that typically degrade traditional algorithm performance.</p>

<h2>Tree level change detection over Ahmedabad city using very high resolution satellite images and Deep Learning</h2>
<h3>Jai G Singla, Gautam Jaiswal</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.02009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, 0.5m high resolution satellite datasets over Indian urban region was used to demonstrate the applicability of deep learning models over Ahmedabad, India. Here, YOLOv7 instance segmentation model was trained on well curated trees canopy dataset (6500 images) in order to carry out the change detection. During training, evaluation metrics such as bounding box regression and mask regression loss, mean average precision (mAP) and stochastic gradient descent algorithm were used for evaluating and optimizing the performance of model. After the 500 epochs, the mAP of 0.715 and 0.699 for individual tree detection and tree canopy mask segmentation were obtained. However, by further tuning hyper parameters of the model, maximum accuracy of 80 % of trees detection with false segmentation rate of 2% on data was obtained.</p>

<h2>DiffSim2Real: Deploying Quadrupedal Locomotion Policies Purely Trained in Differentiable Simulation</h2>
<h3>Joshua Bagajo, Clemens Schwarke, Victor Klemm, Ignat Georgiev, Jean-Pierre Sleiman, Jesus Tordesillas, Animesh Garg, Marco Hutter</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.02189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable simulators provide analytic gradients, enabling more sample-efficient learning algorithms and paving the way for data intensive learning tasks such as learning from images. In this work, we demonstrate that locomotion policies trained with analytic gradients from a differentiable simulator can be successfully transferred to the real world. Typically, simulators that offer informative gradients lack the physical accuracy needed for sim-to-real transfer, and vice-versa. A key factor in our success is a smooth contact model that combines informative gradients with physical accuracy, ensuring effective transfer of learned behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a real quadrupedal robot is able to locomote after training exclusively in a differentiable simulation.</p>

<h2>MetaLoco: Universal Quadrupedal Locomotion with Meta-Reinforcement Learning and Motion Imitation</h2>
<h3>Fatemeh Zargarbashi, Fabrizio Di Giuro, Jin Cheng, Dongho Kang, Bhavya Sukhija, Stelian Coros</h3>
<p>arXiv:2407.17502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a meta-reinforcement learning approach to develop a universal locomotion control policy capable of zero-shot generalization across diverse quadrupedal platforms. The proposed method trains an RL agent equipped with a memory unit to imitate reference motions using a small set of procedurally generated quadruped robots. Through comprehensive simulation and real-world hardware experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in achieving locomotion across various robots without requiring robot-specific fine-tuning. Furthermore, we highlight the critical role of the memory unit in enabling generalization, facilitating rapid adaptation to changes in the robot properties, and improving sample efficiency.</p>

<h2>An unified approach to link prediction in collaboration networks</h2>
<h3>Juan Sosa, Diego Mart\'inez, Nicol\'as Guerrero</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates and compares three approaches to link prediction in colaboration networks, namely, an ERGM (Exponential Random Graph Model; Robins et al. 2007), a GCN (Graph Convolutional Network; Kipf and Welling 2017), and a Word2Vec+MLP model (Word2Vec model combined with a multilayer neural network; Mikolov et al. 2013a and Goodfellow et al. 2016). The ERGM, grounded in statistical methods, is employed to capture general structural patterns within the network, while the GCN and Word2Vec+MLP models leverage deep learning techniques to learn adaptive structural representations of nodes and their relationships. The predictive performance of the models is assessed through extensive simulation exercises using cross-validation, with metrics based on the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results clearly show the superiority of machine learning approaches in link prediction, particularly in large networks, where traditional models such as ERGM exhibit limitations in scalability and the ability to capture inherent complexities. These findings highlight the potential benefits of integrating statistical modeling techniques with deep learning methods to analyze complex networks, providing a more robust and effective framework for future research in this field.</p>
