<h2>Local Optimality of Dictator Functions with Applications to Courtade--Kumar and Li--M\'edard Conjectures</h2>
<h3>Lei Yu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.10147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a convex function $\Phi:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$, the $\Phi$-stability of a Boolean function $f$ is $\mathbb{E}[\Phi(T_{\rho}f(\mathbf{X}))]$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a random vector uniformly distributed on the discrete cube $\{\pm1\}^{n}$ and $T_{\rho}$ is the Bonami-Beckner operator. In this paper, we prove that dictator functions are locally optimal in maximizing the $\Phi$-stability of $f$ over all balanced Boolean functions. When focusing on the symmetric $q$-stability, combining this result with our previous bound, we use computer-assisted methods to prove that dictator functions maximize the symmetric $q$-stability for $q=1$ and $\rho\in[0,0.914]$ or for $q\in[1.36,2)$ and all $\rho\in[0,1]$. In other words, we confirm the (balanced) Courtade--Kumar conjecture with the correlation coefficient $\rho\in[0,0.914]$ and the (symmetrized) Li--M\'edard conjecture with $q\in[1.36,2)$. We conjecture that dictator functions maximize both the symmetric and asymmetric $\frac{1}{2}$-stability over all balanced Boolean functions. Our proofs are based on the majorization of noise operators and hypercontractivity inequalities.</p>

<h2>Graph as a feature: improving node classification with non-neural graph-aware logistic regression</h2>
<h3>Simon Delarue, Thomas Bonald, Tiphaine Viard</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their message passing framework that leverages both structural and feature information, have become a standard method for solving graph-based machine learning problems. However, these approaches still struggle to generalise well beyond datasets that exhibit strong homophily, where nodes of the same class tend to connect. This limitation has led to the development of complex neural architectures that pose challenges in terms of efficiency and scalability. In response to these limitations, we focus on simpler and more scalable approaches and introduce Graph-aware Logistic Regression (GLR), a non-neural model designed for node classification tasks. Unlike traditional graph algorithms that use only a fraction of the information accessible to GNNs, our proposed model simultaneously leverages both node features and the relationships between entities. However instead of relying on message passing, our approach encodes each node's relationships as an additional feature vector, which is then combined with the node's self attributes. Extensive experimental results, conducted within a rigorous evaluation framework, show that our proposed GLR approach outperforms both foundational and sophisticated state-of-the-art GNN models in node classification tasks. Going beyond the traditional limited benchmarks, our experiments indicate that GLR increases generalisation ability while reaching performance gains in computation time up to two orders of magnitude compared to it best neural competitor.</p>

<h2>Data-efficient Tactile Sensing with Electrical Impedance Tomography</h2>

<p>arXiv:2411.12658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)-inspired tactile sensors are gaining attention in robotic tactile sensing due to their cost-effectiveness, safety, and scalability with sparse electrode configurations. This paper presents a data augmentation strategy for learning-based tactile reconstruction that amplifies the original single-frame signal measurement into 32 distinct, effective signal data for training. This approach supplements uncollected conditions of position information, resulting in more accurate and high-resolution tactile reconstructions. Data augmentation for EIT significantly reduces the required EIT measurements and achieves promising performance with even limited samples. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the correlation coefficient by over 12% and reduces the relative error by over 21% under various noise levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a standard deep neural network (DNN) utilizing the proposed data augmentation reduces the required data down to 1/31 while achieving a similar tactile reconstruction quality. Real-world tests further validate the approach's effectiveness on a flexible EIT-based tactile sensor. These results could help address the challenge of training tactile sensing networks with limited available measurements, improving the accuracy and applicability of EIT-based tactile sensing systems.</p>

<h2>Robust-Locomotion-by-Logic: Perturbation-Resilient Bipedal Locomotion via Signal Temporal Logic Guided Model Predictive Control</h2>
<h3>Zhaoyuan Gu, Yuntian Zhao, Yipu Chen, Rongming Guo, Jennifer K. Leestma, Gregory S. Sawicki, Ye Zhao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2403.15993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a robust planning framework that utilizes a model predictive control (MPC) approach, enhanced by incorporating signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. This marks the first-ever study to apply STL-guided trajectory optimization for bipedal locomotion, specifically designed to handle both translational and orientational perturbations. Existing recovery strategies often struggle with reasoning complex task logic and evaluating locomotion robustness systematically, making them susceptible to failures caused by inappropriate recovery strategies or lack of robustness. To address these issues, we design an analytical stability metric for bipedal locomotion and quantify this metric using STL specifications, which guide the generation of recovery trajectories to achieve maximum robustness degree. To enable safe and computational-efficient crossed-leg maneuver, we design data-driven self-leg-collision constraints that are $1000$ times faster than the traditional inverse-kinematics-based approach. Our framework outperforms a state-of-the-art locomotion controller, a standard MPC without STL, and a linear-temporal-logic-based planner in a high-fidelity dynamic simulation, especially in scenarios involving crossed-leg maneuvers. Additionally, the Cassie bipedal robot achieves robust performance under horizontal and orientational perturbations such as those observed in ship motions. These environments are validated in simulations and deployed on hardware. Furthermore, our proposed method demonstrates versatility on stepping stones and terrain-agnostic features on inclined terrains.</p>
