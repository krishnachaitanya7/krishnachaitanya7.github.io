<h2>Large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories: A pedagogical overview</h2>
<h3>Leonardo Santilli</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The different large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories in three, four, and five dimensions are reviewed. We distinguish between the planar limit of SQCD theories, the M-theory limit suited in three and five dimensions, and the long quiver limit. The method to solve exactly the sphere partition functions in each type of limit is spelled out in a pedagogical way. After a comprehensive general treatment of the saddle point approximation in the large $N$ limit, we present an extensive list of examples and detail the calculations. The scope of this overview is to provide an entry-level, computation-oriented understanding of the techniques featured in the field theory side of the AdS/CFT correspondence.</p>

<h2>Conditional Diffusion Model for Electrical Impedance Tomography</h2>
<h3>Duanpeng Shi, Wendong Zheng, Di Guo, Huaping Liu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.05769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging technique, which has been widely used in the fields of industrial inspection, medical monitoring and tactile sensing. However, due to the inherent non-linearity and ill-conditioned nature of the EIT inverse problem, the reconstructed image is highly sensitive to the measured data, and random noise artifacts often appear in the reconstructed image, which greatly limits the application of EIT. To address this issue, a conditional diffusion model with voltage consistency (CDMVC) is proposed in this study. The method consists of a pre-imaging module, a conditional diffusion model for reconstruction, a forward voltage constraint network and a scheme of voltage consistency constraint during sampling process. The pre-imaging module is employed to generate the initial reconstruction. This serves as a condition for training the conditional diffusion model. Finally, based on the forward voltage constraint network, a voltage consistency constraint is implemented in the sampling phase to incorporate forward information of EIT, thereby enhancing imaging quality. A more complete dataset, including both common and complex concave shapes, is generated. The proposed method is validated using both simulation and physical experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improves the quality of reconstructed images. In addition, experimental results also demonstrate that our method has good robustness and generalization performance.</p>

<h2>Distilling Calibration via Conformalized Credal Inference</h2>
<h3>Jiayi Huang, Sangwoo Park, Nicola Paoletti, Osvaldo Simeone</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.</p>

<h2>Optimizing Experiments for Accurate Battery Circuit Parameters Estimation: Reduction and Adjustment of Frequency Set Used in Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy</h2>
<h3>Vladimir Sovljanski, Mario Paolone, Sylvain Tant, Damien Pierre Sainflou</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.06112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a suitable experimental design of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to reduce the number of frequency points while not significantly affecting the uncertainties of the estimated cell's equivalent circuit model (ECM) parameters. It is based on an E-optimal experimental design that aims to maximize the information about the ECM parameters collected by EIS measurements and, at the same time, minimize the overall uncertainty. In a numerical experiment, we first analyze to which extent reducing the number of measurement points at low frequencies affects the uncertainty of the estimated parameters. Secondly, we show that applying the frequency adjustments can lead to the same or even improved global uncertainty of ECM parameter estimates as with a higher number of measurements. This is numerically verified through a case study using the ECM parameters of a commercial battery cell.</p>
