Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a predominant health concern globally, emphasizing the need for advanced diagnostic techniques. In our research, we present an avant-garde methodology that synergistically integrates ECG readings and retinal fundus images to facilitate the early disease tagging as well as triaging of the CVDs in the order of disease priority. Recognizing the intricate vascular network of the retina as a reflection of the cardiovascular system, alongwith the dynamic cardiac insights from ECG, we sought to provide a holistic diagnostic perspective. Initially, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to both the ECG and fundus images, transforming the data into the frequency domain. Subsequently, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) was computed for the frequency-domain features of both modalities. These EMD values were then concatenated, forming a comprehensive feature set that was fed into a Neural Network classifier. This approach, leveraging the FFT's spectral insights and EMD's capability to capture nuanced data differences, offers a robust representation for CVD classification. Preliminary tests yielded a commendable accuracy of 84 percent, underscoring the potential of this combined diagnostic strategy. As we continue our research, we anticipate refining and validating the model further to enhance its clinical applicability in resource limited healthcare ecosystems prevalent across the Indian sub-continent and also the world at large.</p>

<h2>A DeepONet for inverting the Neumann-to-Dirichlet Operator in Electrical Impedance Tomography: An approximation theoretic perspective and numerical results</h2>

<p>arXiv:2407.17182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the non-invasive medical imaging modality of Electrical Impedance Tomography, where the problem is to recover the conductivity in a medium from a set of data that arises out of a current-to-voltage map (Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator) defined on the boundary of the medium. We formulate this inverse problem as an operator-learning problem where the goal is to learn the implicitly defined operator-to-function map between the space of Neumann-to-Dirichlet operators to the space of admissible conductivities. Subsequently, we use an operator-learning architecture, popularly called DeepONets, to learn this operator-to-function map. Thus far, most of the operator learning architectures have been implemented to learn operators between function spaces. In this work, we generalize the earlier works and use a DeepONet to actually {learn an operator-to-function} map. We provide a Universal Approximation Theorem type result which guarantees that this implicitly defined operator-to-function map between the space of Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator to the space of conductivity function can be approximated to an arbitrary degree using such a DeepONet. Furthermore, we provide a computational implementation of our proposed approach and compare it against a standard baseline. We show that the proposed approach achieves good reconstructions and outperforms the baseline method in our experiments.</p>

<h2>PIP-Loco: A Proprioceptive Infinite Horizon Planning Framework for Quadrupedal Robot Locomotion</h2>

<p>arXiv:2409.09441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A core strength of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for quadrupedal locomotion has been its ability to enforce constraints and provide interpretability of the sequence of commands over the horizon. However, despite being able to plan, MPC struggles to scale with task complexity, often failing to achieve robust behavior on rapidly changing surfaces. On the other hand, model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have outperformed MPC on multiple terrains, showing emergent motions but inherently lack any ability to handle constraints or perform planning. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that integrates proprioceptive planning with RL, allowing for agile and safe locomotion behaviors through the horizon. Inspired by MPC, we incorporate an internal model that includes a velocity estimator and a Dreamer module. During training, the framework learns an expert policy and an internal model that are co-dependent, facilitating exploration for improved locomotion behaviors. During deployment, the Dreamer module solves an infinite-horizon MPC problem, adapting actions and velocity commands to respect the constraints. We validate the robustness of our training framework through ablation studies on internal model components and demonstrate improved robustness to training noise. Finally, we evaluate our approach across multi-terrain scenarios in both simulation and hardware.</p>
