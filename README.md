Abstract: Haptics in virtual reality is the emerging dimension after audiovisual experiences. Researchers designed several handheld VR controllers to simulate haptic experiences in virtual reality environments. Some of these devices, equipped to deliver active force, can dynamically alter the timing and intensity of force feedback, potentially offering a wide array of haptic sensations. Past research primarily used a single index to evaluate how users perceive physical property parameters, potentially limiting the assessment to the designer's intended scope and neglecting other potential perceptual experiences.
  Therefore, this study evaluates not how much but how humans feel a physical property when stimuli are changed. We conducted interviews to investigate how people feel when a haptic device changes motion impedance. We used thematic analysis to abstract the results of the interviews and gain an understanding of how humans attribute force feedback to a phenomenon. We also generated a vocabulary from the themes obtained from the interviews and asked users to evaluate force feedback using the semantic difference method. A factor analysis was used to investigate how changing the basic elements of motion, such as inertia, viscosity, and stiffness of the motion system, affects haptic perception. As a result, we obtained four critical factors: size, viscosity, weight, and flexibility factor, and clarified the correspondence between these factors and the change of impedance.</p>

Abstract: Code Language Models (codeLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in code vulnerability detection. However, GNNs often rely on aggregating information from adjacent nodes, limiting structural information propagation across layers. While codeLMs can supplement GNNs with semantic information, existing integration methods underexplore their collaborative potential. To address these challenges, we propose Vul-LMGNNs, integrating pre-trained codeLMs with GNNs to enable cross-layer propagation of semantic and structural information. Vul-LMGNNs leverage Code Property Graphs (CPGs) to incorporate syntax, control flow, and data dependencies, using gated GNNs for structural extraction. An online knowledge distillation (KD) mechanism allows a student GNN to capture structural information from a trained counterpart via alternating training. Additionally, an "implicit-explicit" joint training framework leverages codeLMs to initialize embeddings and propagate code semantics. In the explicit phase, it performs late fusion via linear interpolation. Evaluations on real-world vulnerability datasets show Vul-LMGNNs outperform 17 state-of-the-art approaches.

<h2>Compressing regularized dynamics improves link prediction with the map equation in sparse networks</h2>

<p>arXiv:2410.08777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting future interactions or novel links in networks is an indispensable tool across diverse domains, including genetic research, online social networks, and recommendation systems. Among the numerous techniques developed for link prediction, those leveraging the networks' community structure have proven highly effective. For example, the recently proposed MapSim predicts links based on a similarity measure derived from the code structure of the map equation, a community-detection objective function that operates on network flows. However, the standard map equation assumes complete observations and typically identifies many small modules in networks where the nodes connect through only a few links. This aspect can degrade MapSim's performance on sparse networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose to incorporate a global regularization method based on a Bayesian estimate of the transition rates along with three local regularization methods. The regularized versions of the map equation compensate for incomplete observations and mitigate spurious community fragmentation in sparse networks. The regularized methods outperform standard MapSim and several state-of-the-art embedding methods in highly sparse networks. This performance holds across multiple real-world networks with randomly removed links, simulating incomplete observations. Among the proposed regularization methods, the global approach provides the most reliable community detection and the highest link prediction performance across different network densities. The principled method requires no hyperparameter tuning and runs at least an order of magnitude faster than the embedding methods.</p>

<h2>Knowledge-aware contrastive heterogeneous molecular graph learning</h2>

<p>arXiv:2502.11711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular representation learning is pivotal in predicting molecular properties and advancing drug design. Traditional methodologies, which predominantly rely on homogeneous graph encoding, are limited by their inability to integrate external knowledge and represent molecular structures across different levels of granularity. To address these limitations, we propose a paradigm shift by encoding molecular graphs into heterogeneous structures, introducing a novel framework: Knowledge-aware Contrastive Heterogeneous Molecular Graph Learning (KCHML). This approach leverages contrastive learning to enrich molecular representations with embedded external knowledge. KCHML conceptualizes molecules through three distinct graph views-molecular, elemental, and pharmacological-enhanced by heterogeneous molecular graphs and a dual message-passing mechanism. This design offers a comprehensive representation for property prediction, as well as for downstream tasks such as drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates KCHML's superiority over state-of-the-art molecular property prediction models, underscoring its ability to capture intricate molecular features.</p>
