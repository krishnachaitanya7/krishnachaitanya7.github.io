Abstract: We propose a predator-prey model with an age-structured predator population that exhibits a functional role reversal. The structure of the predator population in our model embodies the ecological concept of an "ontogenetic niche shift," in which a species' functional role changes as it grows. This structure adds complexity to our model but increases its biological relevance. The time evolution of the age-structured predator population is motivated by the Kermack-McKendrick Renewal Equation (KMRE). Unlike KMRE, the predator population's birth and death rate functions depend on the prey population's size. We establish the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of the solutions to the proposed model's initial value problem. The dynamical properties of the proposed model are investigated via Latin Hypercube Sampling in the 15-dimensional space of its parameters. Our Linear Discriminant Analysis suggests that the most influential parameters are the maturation age of the predator and the rate of consumption of juvenile predators by the prey. We carry out a detailed study of the long-term behavior of the proposed model as a function of these two parameters. In addition, we reduce the proposed age-structured model to ordinary and delayed differential equation (ODE and DDE) models. The comparison of the long-term behavior of the ODE, DDE, and the age-structured models with matching parameter settings shows that the age structure promotes the instability of the Coexistence Equilibrium and the emergence of the Coexistence Periodic Attractor.</p>

<h2>Evaluation of acoustic Green's function in rectangular rooms with general surface impedance walls</h2>

<p>arXiv:2602.09594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic room modes and the Green's function mode expansion are well-known for rectangular rooms with perfectly reflecting walls. First-order approximations also exist for nearly rigid boundaries; however, current analytical methods fail to accommodate more general boundary conditions, e.g., when wall absorption is significant. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis that extends previous studies by including additional first-order asymptotics that account for soft-wall boundaries. In addition, we introduce a semi-analytical, efficient, and reliable method for computing the Green's function in rectangular rooms, which is described and validated through numerical tests. With a sufficiently large truncation order, the resulting error becomes negligible, making the method suitable as a benchmark for numerical simulations. Additional aspects regarding the spectral basis orthogonality and completeness are also addressed, providing a general framework for the validity of the proposed approach.</p>

<h2>Toward Reliable Sim-to-Real Predictability for MoE-based Robust Quadrupedal Locomotion</h2>

<p>arXiv:2602.00678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has shown strong promise for quadrupedal agile locomotion, even with proprioception-only sensing. In practice, however, sim-to-real gap and reward overfitting in complex terrains can produce policies that fail to transfer, while physical validation remains risky and inefficient. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified framework encompassing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) locomotion policy for robust multi-terrain representation with RoboGauge, a predictive assessment suite that quantifies sim-to-real transferability. The MoE policy employs a gated set of specialist experts to decompose latent terrain and command modeling, achieving superior deployment robustness and generalization via proprioception alone. RoboGauge further provides multi-dimensional proprioception-based metrics via sim-to-sim tests over terrains, difficulty levels, and domain randomizations, enabling reliable MoE policy selection without extensive physical trials. Experiments on a Unitree Go2 demonstrate robust locomotion on unseen challenging terrains, including snow, sand, stairs, slopes, and 30 cm obstacles. In dedicated high-speed tests, the robot reaches 4 m/s and exhibits an emergent narrow-width gait associated with improved stability at high velocity.</p>
