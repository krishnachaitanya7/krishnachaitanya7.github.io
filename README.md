<h2>Helmholtz transmission problem and intrinsic impedance scattering problem on extension domains</h2>
<h3>Gabriel Claret (MICS)</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.14866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a transmission problem for the Helmholtz equation across the boundary of an extension domain. A such boundary can be Lipschitz, fractal, or of varying Hausdorff dimension for instance. We generalise the notions of layer potential and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators, and of Calder{\'o}n projectors in that context. Those boundary operators allow to connect the transmission problem (on the whole space) to one-sided problems -- notably, scattering problems -- with Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions. Since an extension domain needs no specific boundary measure, the Robin (impedance) condition is not understood in a boundary L^2-type space, rather by duality on the trace space itself. We discuss the well-posedness of the impedance scattering problem in that framework and compare to the classical L^2 setting. Our analysis allows to generalise optimisation results for acoustic scattering when the obstacle is an extension domain in any dimension.</p>

Abstract: Background: The integration of haptic feedback into robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) has long been limited by challenges in accurately rendering forces and ensuring system safety. The need for robust, high-fidelity haptic systems is critical for enhancing the precision and reliability of teleoperated surgical tools. Methods: In this study, we present a Nonlinear Impedance Matching Approach (NIMA) designed to improve force rendering by accurately modelling complex tool-tissue interactions. Based on our previously validated Impedance Matching Approach (IMA), our novel NIMA method includes nonlinear dynamics to capture and render tool-tissue forces effectively. Results: NIMA improves force feedback accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.01 (SD 0.02) N, achieving a 95% reduction in MAE compared to IMA. Furthermore, NIMA effectively eliminates haptic "kickback" by ensuring no force is applied by the haptic device to the user's hand when they release the handle, enhancing both patient safety and user comfort. Conclusion: NIMA's ability to account for nonlinearities in tool-tissue interactions provides an improvement in force fidelity, responsiveness, and precision across various surgical conditions. Our findings promote the advancement of haptic feedback systems for robotic surgery, offering a realistic and reliable interface for robot-assisted surgical procedures.</p>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent tutoring systems, yet research on optimizing LLMs specifically for educational contexts remains limited. Recent works have proposed reinforcement learning approaches for training LLM tutors, but these methods focus solely on optimizing visible responses while neglecting the model's internal thinking process. We introduce PedagogicalRL-Thinking, a framework that extends pedagogical alignment to reasoning LLMs in education through two novel approaches: (1) Pedagogical Reasoning Prompting, which guides internal reasoning using domain-specific educational theory rather than generic instructions; and (2) Thinking Reward, which explicitly evaluates and reinforces the pedagogical quality of the model's reasoning traces. Our experiments reveal that domain-specific, theory-grounded prompting outperforms generic prompting, and that Thinking Reward is most effective when combined with pedagogical prompting. Furthermore, models trained only on mathematics tutoring dialogues show improved performance on educational benchmarks not seen during training, while preserving the base model's factual knowledge. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that pedagogical thinking reward produces systematic reasoning trace changes, with increased pedagogical reasoning and more structured instructional decision-making in the tutor's thinking process.</p>

<h2>HumanoidVLM: Vision-Language-Guided Impedance Control for Contact-Rich Humanoid Manipulation</h2>
<h3>Yara Mahmoud, Yasheerah Yaqoot, Miguel Altamirano Cabrera, Dzmitry Tsetserukou</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.14874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid robots must adapt their contact behavior to diverse objects and tasks, yet most controllers rely on fixed, hand-tuned impedance gains and gripper settings. This paper introduces HumanoidVLM, a vision-language driven retrieval framework that enables the Unitree G1 humanoid to select task-appropriate Cartesian impedance parameters and gripper configurations directly from an egocentric RGB image. The system couples a vision-language model for semantic task inference with a FAISS-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves experimentally validated stiffness-damping pairs and object-specific grasp angles from two custom databases, and executes them through a task-space impedance controller for compliant manipulation. We evaluate HumanoidVLM on 14 visual scenarios and achieve a retrieval accuracy of 93%. Real-world experiments show stable interaction dynamics, with z-axis tracking errors typically within 1-3.5 cm and virtual forces consistent with task-dependent impedance settings. These results demonstrate the feasibility of linking semantic perception with retrieval-based control as an interpretable path toward adaptive humanoid manipulation.</p>

<h2>Teaching Spell Checkers to Teach: Pedagogical Program Synthesis for Interactive Learning</h2>

Abstract: Spelling taught through memorization often fails many learners, particularly children with language-based learning disorders who struggle with the phonological skills necessary to spell words accurately. Educators such as speech-language pathologists (SLPs) address this instructional gap by using an inquiry-based approach to teach spelling that targets the phonology, morphology, meaning, and etymology of words. Yet, these strategies rarely appear in everyday writing tools, which simply detect and autocorrect errors. We introduce SPIRE (Spelling Inquiry Engine), a spell check system that brings this inquiry-based pedagogy into the act of composition. SPIRE implements Pedagogical Program Synthesis, a novel approach for operationalizing the inherently dynamic pedagogy of spelling instruction. SPIRE represents SLP instructional moves in a domain-specific language, synthesizes tailored programs in real-time from learner errors, and renders them as interactive interfaces for inquiry-based interventions. With SPIRE, spelling errors become opportunities to explore word meanings, word structures, morphological families, word origins, and grapheme-phoneme correspondences, supporting metalinguistic reasoning alongside correction. Evaluation with SLPs and learners shows alignment with professional practice and potential for integration into writing workflows.</p>
