<h2>Teaching Programming in the Age of Generative AI: Insights from Literature, Pedagogical Proposals, and Student Perspectives</h2>
<h3>Clemente Rubio-Manzano, Jazna Meza, Rodolfo Fernandez-Santibanez, Christian Vidal-Castro</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer programming is undergoing a true transformation driven by powerful new tools for automatic source code generation based on large language models. This transformation is also manifesting in introductory programming courses at universities around the world, generating an in-depth debate about how programming content should be taught, learned, and assessed in the context of generative artificial intelligence.
  This article aims, on the one hand, to review the most relevant studies on this issue, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages identified in the specialized literature. On the other hand, it proposes enriching teaching and learning methodologies by focusing on code comprehension and execution rather than on mere coding or program functionality. In particular, it advocates for the use of visual representations of code and visual simulations of its execution as effective tools for teaching, learning, and assessing programming, thus fostering a deeper understanding among students.
  Finally, the opinions of students who took the object-oriented programming course are presented to provide preliminary context supporting the incorporation of visual simulations in Java (or other languages) as part of the training process.</p>

<p>arXiv:2507.00406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback is one of the most crucial components to facilitate effective learning. With the rise of large language models (LLMs) in recent years, research in programming education has increasingly focused on automated feedback generation to help teachers provide timely support to every student. However, prior studies often overlook key pedagogical principles, such as mastery and progress adaptation, that shape effective feedback strategies. This paper introduces a novel pedagogical framework for LLM-driven feedback generation derived from established feedback models and local insights from secondary school teachers. To evaluate this framework, we implemented a web-based application for Python programming with LLM-based feedback that follows the framework and conducted a mixed-method evaluation with eight secondary-school computer science teachers. Our findings suggest that teachers consider that, when aligned with the framework, LLMs can effectively support students and even outperform human teachers in certain scenarios through instant and precise feedback. However, we also found several limitations, such as its inability to adapt feedback to dynamic classroom contexts. Such a limitation highlights the need to complement LLM-generated feedback with human expertise to ensure effective student learning. This work demonstrates an effective way to use LLMs for feedback while adhering to pedagogical standards and highlights important considerations for future systems.</p>

Abstract: Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND) pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks. We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to 89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards at https://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to influence education and help to address the global learning crisis. Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and policy decisions.</p>
