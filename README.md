Abstract: Image-based, patient-specific modelling of hemodynamics can improve diagnostic capabilities and provide complementary insights to better understand the hemodynamic treatment outcomes. However, computational fluid dynamics simulations remain relatively costly in a clinical context. Moreover, projection-based reduced-order models and purely data-driven surrogate models struggle due to the high variability of anatomical shapes in a population. A possible solution is shape registration: a reference template geometry is designed from a cohort of available geometries, which can then be diffeomorphically mapped onto it. This provides a natural encoding that can be exploited by machine learning architectures and, at the same time, a reference computational domain in which efficient dimension-reduction strategies can be performed. We compare state-of-the-art graph neural network models with recent data assimilation strategies for the prediction of physical quantities and clinically relevant biomarkers in the context of aortic coarctation.</p>

<h2>Towards Self-Supervised Covariance Estimation in Deep Heteroscedastic Regression</h2>
<h3>Megh Shukla, Aziz Shameem, Mathieu Salzmann, Alexandre Alahi</h3>
<p>arXiv:2502.10587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep heteroscedastic regression models the mean and covariance of the target distribution through neural networks. The challenge arises from heteroscedasticity, which implies that the covariance is sample dependent and is often unknown. Consequently, recent methods learn the covariance through unsupervised frameworks, which unfortunately yield a trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy. While this trade-off could be alleviated through supervision, obtaining labels for the covariance is non-trivial. Here, we study self-supervised covariance estimation in deep heteroscedastic regression. We address two questions: (1) How should we supervise the covariance assuming ground truth is available? (2) How can we obtain pseudo labels in the absence of the ground-truth? We address (1) by analysing two popular measures: the KL Divergence and the 2-Wasserstein distance. Subsequently, we derive an upper bound on the 2-Wasserstein distance between normal distributions with non-commutative covariances that is stable to optimize. We address (2) through a simple neighborhood based heuristic algorithm which results in surprisingly effective pseudo labels for the covariance. Our experiments over a wide range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed 2-Wasserstein bound coupled with pseudo label annotations results in a computationally cheaper yet accurate deep heteroscedastic regression.</p>

<h2>Knowledge-aware contrastive heterogeneous molecular graph learning</h2>

<p>arXiv:2502.11711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular representation learning is pivotal in predicting molecular properties and advancing drug design. Traditional methodologies, which predominantly rely on homogeneous graph encoding, are limited by their inability to integrate external knowledge and represent molecular structures across different levels of granularity. To address these limitations, we propose a paradigm shift by encoding molecular graphs into heterogeneous structures, introducing a novel framework: Knowledge-aware Contrastive Heterogeneous Molecular Graph Learning (KCHML). This approach leverages contrastive learning to enrich molecular representations with embedded external knowledge. KCHML conceptualizes molecules through three distinct graph views-molecular, elemental, and pharmacological-enhanced by heterogeneous molecular graphs and a dual message-passing mechanism. This design offers a comprehensive representation for property prediction, as well as for downstream tasks such as drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates KCHML's superiority over state-of-the-art molecular property prediction models, underscoring its ability to capture intricate molecular features.</p>
