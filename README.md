<h2>Research on the application of graph data structure and graph neural network in node classification/clustering tasks</h2>
<h3>Yihan Wang, Jianing Zhao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.19527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-structured data are pervasive across domains including social networks, biological networks, and knowledge graphs. Due to their non-Euclidean nature, such data pose significant challenges to conventional machine learning methods. This study investigates graph data structures, classical graph algorithms, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), providing comprehensive theoretical analysis and comparative evaluation. Through comparative experiments, we quantitatively assess performance differences between traditional algorithms and GNNs in node classification and clustering tasks. Results show GNNs achieve substantial accuracy improvements of 43% to 70% over traditional methods. We further explore integration strategies between classical algorithms and GNN architectures, providing theoretical guidance for advancing graph representation learning research.</p>

<h2>PEMUTA: Pedagogically-Enriched Multi-Granular Undergraduate Thesis Assessment</h2>

Abstract: The undergraduate thesis (UGTE) plays an indispensable role in assessing a student's cumulative academic development throughout their college years. Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced education intelligence, they typically focus on holistic assessment with only one single evaluation score, but ignore the intricate nuances across multifaceted criteria, limiting their ability to reflect structural criteria, pedagogical objectives, and diverse academic competencies. Meanwhile, pedagogical theories have long informed manual UGTE evaluation through multi-dimensional assessment of cognitive development, disciplinary thinking, and academic performance, yet remain underutilized in automated settings. Motivated by the research gap, we pioneer PEMUTA, a pedagogically-enriched framework that effectively activates domain-specific knowledge from LLMs for multi-granular UGTE assessment. Guided by Vygotsky's theory and Bloom's Taxonomy, PEMUTA incorporates a hierarchical prompting scheme that evaluates UGTEs across six fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Logic, Originality, Writing, Proficiency, and Rigor (SLOWPR), followed by holistic synthesis. Two in-context learning techniques, \ie, few-shot prompting and role-play prompting, are also incorporated to further enhance alignment with expert judgments without fine-tuning. We curate a dataset of authentic UGTEs with expert-provided SLOWPR-aligned annotations to support multi-granular UGTE assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PEMUTA achieves strong alignment with expert evaluations, and exhibits strong potential for fine-grained, pedagogically-informed UGTE evaluations.</p>

<h2>RAKOMO: Reachability-Aware K-Order Markov Path Optimization for Quadrupedal Loco-Manipulation</h2>
<h3>Mattia Risiglione, Abdelrahman Abdalla, Victor Barasuol, Kim Tien Ly, Ioannis Havoutis, Claudio Semini</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.19652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legged manipulators, such as quadrupeds equipped with robotic arms, require motion planning techniques that account for their complex kinematic constraints in order to perform manipulation tasks both safely and effectively. However, trajectory optimization methods often face challenges due to the hybrid dynamics introduced by contact discontinuities, and tend to neglect leg limitations during planning for computational reasons. In this work, we propose RAKOMO, a path optimization technique that integrates the strengths of K-Order Markov Optimization (KOMO) with a kinematically-aware criterion based on the reachable region defined as reachability margin. We leverage a neural-network to predict the margin and optimize it by incorporating it in the standard KOMO formulation. This approach enables rapid convergence of gradient-based motion planning -- commonly tailored for continuous systems -- while adapting it effectively to legged manipulators, successfully executing loco-manipulation tasks. We benchmark RAKOMO against a baseline KOMO approach through a set of simulations for pick-and-place tasks with the HyQReal quadruped robot equipped with a Kinova Gen3 robotic arm.</p>

<h2>Cultivating Helpful, Personalized, and Creative AI Tutors: A Framework for Pedagogical Alignment using Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<h3>Siyu Song, Wentao Liu, Ye Lu, Ruohua Zhang, Tao Liu, Jinze Lv, Xinyun Wang, Aimin Zhou, Fei Tan, Bo Jiang, Hao Hao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.20335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into education presents unprecedented opportunities for scalable personalized learning. However, standard LLMs often function as generic information providers, lacking alignment with fundamental pedagogical principles such as helpfulness, student-centered personalization, and creativity cultivation. To bridge this gap, we propose EduAlign, a novel framework designed to guide LLMs toward becoming more effective and responsible educational assistants. EduAlign consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we curate a dataset of 8k educational interactions and annotate them-both manually and automatically-along three key educational dimensions: Helpfulness, Personalization, and Creativity (HPC). These annotations are used to train HPC-RM, a multi-dimensional reward model capable of accurately scoring LLM outputs according to these educational principles. We further evaluate the consistency and reliability of this reward model. In the second stage, we leverage HPC-RM as a reward signal to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on a set of 2k diverse prompts. We then assess the pre- and post-finetuning models on both educational and general-domain benchmarks across the three HPC dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits significantly improved alignment with pedagogical helpfulness, personalization, and creativity stimulation. This study presents a scalable and effective approach to aligning LLMs with nuanced and desirable educational traits, paving the way for the development of more engaging, pedagogically aligned AI tutors.</p>

<h2>Bipedalism for Quadrupedal Robots: Versatile Loco-Manipulation through Risk-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<h3>Yuyou Zhang, Radu Corcodel, Ding Zhao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.20382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loco-manipulation of quadrupedal robots has broadened robotic applications, but using legs as manipulators often compromises locomotion, while mounting arms complicates the system. To mitigate this issue, we introduce bipedalism for quadrupedal robots, thus freeing the front legs for versatile interactions with the environment. We propose a risk-adaptive distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework designed for quadrupedal robots walking on their hind legs, balancing worst-case conservativeness with optimal performance in this inherently unstable task. During training, the adaptive risk preference is dynamically adjusted based on the uncertainty of the return, measured by the coefficient of variation of the estimated return distribution. Extensive experiments in simulation show our method's superior performance over baselines. Real-world deployment on a Unitree Go2 robot further demonstrates the versatility of our policy, enabling tasks like cart pushing, obstacle probing, and payload transport, while showcasing robustness against challenging dynamics and external disturbances.</p>

<h2>Are ECGs enough? Deep learning classification of pulmonary embolism using electrocardiograms</h2>
<h3>Joao D. S. Marques, Arlindo L. Oliveira</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.08960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulmonary embolism is a leading cause of out of hospital cardiac arrest that requires fast diagnosis. While computed tomography pulmonary angiography is the standard diagnostic tool, it is not always accessible. Electrocardiography is an essential tool for diagnosing mul- tiple cardiac anomalies, as it is affordable, fast and available in many settings. However, the availability of public ECG datasets, specially for PE, is limited and, in practice, these datasets tend to be small, making it essential to optimize learning strategies. In this study, we investigate the performance of multiple neural networks in order to assess the impact of various approaches. Moreover, we check whether these practices enhance model generalization when transfer learning is used to translate infor- mation learned in larger ECG datasets, such as PTB-XL, CPSC18 and MedalCare-XL, to a smaller, more challenging dataset for PE. By lever- aging transfer learning, we analyze the extent to which we can improve learning efficiency and predictive performance on limited data.
