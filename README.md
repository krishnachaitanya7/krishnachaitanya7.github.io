Abstract: Diagnosing knee osteoarthritis (OA) early is crucial for managing symptoms and preventing further joint damage, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life. In this paper, a bioimpedance-based diagnostic tool that combines precise hardware and deep learning for effective non-invasive diagnosis is proposed. system features a relay-based circuit and strategically placed electrodes to capture comprehensive bioimpedance data. The data is processed by a neural network model, which has been optimized using convolutional layers, dropout regularization, and the Adam optimizer. This approach achieves a 98% test accuracy, making it a promising tool for detecting knee osteoarthritis musculoskeletal disorders.</p>
