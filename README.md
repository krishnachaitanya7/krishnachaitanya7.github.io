<h2>Modeling the Prey-Predator Dynamics of Habu Snakes and Mongooses Leading to Ecological Disaster on Amami Oshima Island in Japan</h2>
<h3>Pulak Kundu, Uzzwal Kumar Mallick</h3>
<p>arXiv:2512.12388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of mongooses from Indian subcontinent to Amami Oshima Island, Japan, aimed at controlling the population of venomous Habu snakes, has led to significant ecological disruptions, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of the islands biodiversity. To highlight the unintended consequences of such interventions and the necessity of understanding predator-prey dynamics in preserving ecological balance, a mathematical model incorporating snake, mongooses, mouse and natural resources has been proposed to explore their role in the ongoing ecological disaster and analysis the other scenarios if the authorities applied different approaches in place of already implemented strategy. Determining the model's existence and uniqueness, stability at equilibrium points, and state variable characteristics are some of the parts of the analytical analysis of the model. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify sensitive factors. In addition, the Runge-Kutta 4th order has been used to execute the numerical simulations. Our research reveals that although the government began killing and trapping mongooses almost 20 years after their introduction, but if trapping had started just 10 years after their introduction, the outcome could have been drastically different. This time, mongooses would not have been extinct, and their coexistence with other native species would have helped to preserve the ecological balance and prevent the severe ecological damage that is presently being seen. Thus, It is recommended to use mathematical modeling to explore alternatives before decision-making, ensuring sustainable ecosystem management while preventing irreversible impacts of invasive species.</p>

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education continues to evoke both promise and skepticism. While past waves of technological optimism often fell short, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revived the vision of scalable, individualized tutoring. This paper presents the design and pilot evaluation of RockStartIT Tutor, an AI-powered assistant developed for a digital programming and computational thinking course within the RockStartIT initiative. Powered by GPT-4 via OpenAI's Assistant API, the tutor employs a novel prompting strategy and a modular, semantically tagged knowledge base to deliver context-aware, personalized, and curriculum-constrained support for secondary school students. We evaluated the system using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with 13 students and teachers. Learners appreciated the low-stakes environment for asking questions and receiving scaffolded guidance. Educators emphasized the system's potential to reduce cognitive load during independent tasks and complement classroom teaching. Key challenges include prototype limitations, a small sample size, and the need for long-term studies with the target age group. Our findings highlight a pragmatic approach to AI integration that requires no model training, using structure and prompts to shape behavior. We position AI tutors not as teacher replacements but as enabling tools that extend feedback access, foster inquiry, and support what schools do best: help students learn.</p>

<h2>Teaching Spell Checkers to Teach: Pedagogical Program Synthesis for Interactive Learning</h2>
<h3>Momin N. Siddiqui, Vincent Cavez, Sahana Rangasrinivasan, Abbie Olszewski, Srirangaraj Setlur, Maneesh Agrawala, Hari Subramonyam</h3>
<p>arXiv:2512.12115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spelling taught through memorization often fails many learners, particularly children with language-based learning disorders who struggle with the phonological skills necessary to spell words accurately. Educators such as speech-language pathologists (SLPs) address this instructional gap by using an inquiry-based approach to teach spelling that targets the phonology, morphology, meaning, and etymology of words. Yet, these strategies rarely appear in everyday writing tools, which simply detect and autocorrect errors. We introduce SPIRE (Spelling Inquiry Engine), a spell check system that brings this inquiry-based pedagogy into the act of composition. SPIRE implements Pedagogical Program Synthesis, a novel approach for operationalizing the inherently dynamic pedagogy of spelling instruction. SPIRE represents SLP instructional moves in a domain-specific language, synthesizes tailored programs in real-time from learner errors, and renders them as interactive interfaces for inquiry-based interventions. With SPIRE, spelling errors become opportunities to explore word meanings, word structures, morphological families, word origins, and grapheme-phoneme correspondences, supporting metalinguistic reasoning alongside correction. Evaluation with SLPs and learners shows alignment with professional practice and potential for integration into writing workflows.</p>

<h2>Learning Terrain Aware Bipedal Locomotion via Reduced Dimensional Perceptual Representations</h2>
<h3>Guillermo A. Castillo, Himanshu Lodha, Ayonga Hereid</h3>
<p>arXiv:2512.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a hierarchical strategy for terrain-aware bipedal locomotion that integrates reduced-dimensional perceptual representations to enhance reinforcement learning (RL)-based high-level (HL) policies for real-time gait generation. Unlike end-to-end approaches, our framework leverages latent terrain encodings via a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CNN-VAE) alongside reduced-order robot dynamics, optimizing the locomotion decision process with a compact state. We systematically analyze the impact of latent space dimensionality on learning efficiency and policy robustness. Additionally, we extend our method to be history-aware, incorporating sequences of recent terrain observations into the latent representation to improve robustness. To address real-world feasibility, we introduce a distillation method to learn the latent representation directly from depth camera images and provide preliminary hardware validation by comparing simulated and real sensor data. We further validate our framework using the high-fidelity Agility Robotics (AR) simulator, incorporating realistic sensor noise, state estimation, and actuator dynamics. The results confirm the robustness and adaptability of our method, underscoring its potential for hardware deployment.</p>

<p>arXiv:2502.13707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans are experts in physical collaboration by leveraging cognitive abilities such as perception, reasoning, and decision-making to regulate compliance behaviors based on their partners' states and task requirements. Equipping robots with similar cognitive-inspired collaboration skills can significantly enhance the efficiency and adaptability of human-robot collaboration (HRC). This paper introduces an innovative HumanInspired Impedance Regulation Skill Learning framework (HIImpRSL) for robotic systems to achieve leader-follower and mutual adaptation in multiple physical collaborative tasks. The proposed framework enables the robot to adapt its compliance based on human states and reference trajectories derived from human-human demonstrations. By integrating electromyography (EMG) signals and motion data, we extract endpoint impedance profiles and reference trajectories to construct a joint representation via imitation learning. An LSTM-based module then learns task-oriented impedance regulation policies, which are implemented through a whole-body impedance controller for online impedance adaptation. Experimental validation was conducted through collaborative transportation, two interactive Tai Chi pushing hands, and collaborative sawing tasks with multiple human subjects, demonstrating the ability of our framework to achieve human-like collaboration skills and the superior performance from the perspective of interactive forces compared to four other related methods.</p>

<h2>Physics-informed neural network for fatigue life prediction of irradiated austenitic and ferritic/martensitic steels</h2>
<h3>Dhiraj S Kori, Abhinav Chandraker, Syed Abdur Rahman, Punit Rathore, Ankur Chauhan</h3>
<p>arXiv:2508.17303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. During operation, these materials undergo cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, resulting in complex degradation mechanisms that traditional empirical or purely data-driven models often fail to capture accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy, reliability, and generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and unirradiated conditions, the model is more robust than traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and the conventional Neural Network. Model interpretability assessed via SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis revealed that strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and test temperature are the dominant features, each exhibiting a physically consistent inverse correlation with fatigue life. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that strain amplitude is the primary driver of fatigue degradation in both alloy classes, while irradiation dose and temperature introduce alloy-specific sensitivities. The PINN successfully captured key mechanistic trends, including the comparatively stable irradiation response and dose saturation behaviour of F/M steels, as well as a pronounced reduction in fatigue life at elevated temperatures exceeding the tempering threshold. Overall, the proposed PINN framework offers a reliable and interpretable tool for predicting fatigue life in irradiated structural alloys, thereby supporting informed materials selection and performance assessment for advanced nuclear reactor applications.</p>

<p>arXiv:2512.04475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning on graphs has recently achieved impressive progress in various domains, including molecular property prediction and chip design. However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance.

<h2>A Physics-Embedded Dual-Learning Imaging Framework for Electrical Impedance Tomography</h2>
<h3>Xuanxuan Yang, Yangming Zhang, Haofeng Chen, Gang Ma, Xiaojie Wang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.17827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a promising noninvasive imaging technique that reconstructs the spatial conductivity distribution from boundary voltage measurements. However, it poses a highly nonlinear and ill-posed inverse problem. Traditional regularization-based methods are sensitive to noise and often produce significant artifacts. Physics-Embedded learning frameworks, particularly Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), have shown success in solving such inverse problems under ideal conditions with abundant internal data. Yet in practical EIT applications, only sparse and noisy boundary measurements are available. Moreover, changing boundary excitations require the simultaneous training of multiple forward networks and one inverse network, which significantly increases computational complexity and hampers convergence. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Physics-Embedded Dual-Learning Imaging Framework for EIT. The dual-learning strategy is composed of a supervised CNN-based forward network, which learns to predict a discrete internal potential distribution under fixed Neumann-to-Dirichlet boundary conditions, and an unsupervised PINN-based inverse network, which reconstructs the conductivity by enforcing the governing PDE through discrete numerical differentiation of the predicted potentials. This decoupled architecture removes the need for smooth conductivity assumptions, reduces the number of forward networks required from $K$ to 1, and improves reconstruction robustness and efficiency under realistic measurement constraints.(https://github.com/XuanxuanYang/CNN-PINNframework.git)</p>

<h2>Credal Prediction based on Relative Likelihood</h2>
<h3>Timo L\"ohr, Paul Hofman, Felix Mohr, Eyke H\"ullermeier</h3>
<p>arXiv:2505.22332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictions in the form of sets of probability distributions, so-called credal sets, provide a suitable means to represent a learner's epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to credal prediction based on the statistical notion of relative likelihood: The target of prediction is the set of all (conditional) probability distributions produced by the collection of plausible models, namely those models whose relative likelihood exceeds a specified threshold. This threshold has an intuitive interpretation and allows for controlling the trade-off between correctness and precision of credal predictions. We tackle the problem of approximating credal sets defined in this way by means of suitably modified ensemble learning techniques. To validate our approach, we illustrate its effectiveness by experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrating superior uncertainty representation without compromising predictive performance. We also compare our method against several state-of-the-art baselines in credal prediction.</p>

<h2>Robust tests for parameter change in conditionally heteroscedastic time series models</h2>
<h3>Junmo Song</h3>
<p>arXiv:2512.12946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural changes and outliers often coexist, complicating statistical inference. This paper addresses the problem of testing for parameter changes in conditionally heteroscedastic time series models, particularly in the presence of outliers. To mitigate the impact of outliers, we introduce a two-step procedure comprising robust estimation and residual truncation. Based on this procedure, we propose a residual-based robust CUSUM test and its self-normalized counterpart. We derive the limiting null distributions of the proposed robust tests and establish their consistency. Simulation results demonstrate the strong robustness of the tests against outliers. To illustrate the practical application, we analyze Bitcoin data.</p>
