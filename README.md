Abstract: Although hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing complex datasets, their practical performance often remains limited. On one hand, existing networks typically employ a single type of attention mechanism, focusing on either structural or feature similarities during message passing. On the other hand, assuming that all nodes in current hypergraph models have the same level of overlap may lead to suboptimal generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework, overlap-aware meta-learning attention for hypergraph neural networks (OMA-HGNN). First, we introduce a hypergraph attention mechanism that integrates both structural and feature similarities. Specifically, we linearly combine their respective losses with weighted factors for the HGNN model. Second, we partition nodes into different tasks based on their diverse overlap levels and develop a multi-task Meta-Weight-Net (MWN) to determine the corresponding weighted factors. Third, we jointly train the internal MWN model with the losses from the external HGNN model and train the external model with the weighted factors from the internal model. To evaluate the effectiveness of OMA-HGNN, we conducted experiments on six real-world datasets and benchmarked its perfor-mance against nine state-of-the-art methods for node classification. The results demonstrate that OMA-HGNN excels in learning superior node representations and outperforms these baselines.</p>
