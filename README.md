<h2>A piecewise deterministic model for a prey-predator community</h2>
<h3>Manon Costa</h3>
<p>arXiv:1503.02492v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in prey-predator communities where the predator population evolves much faster than the prey's (e.g. insect-tree communities). We introduce a piecewise deterministic model for these prey-predator communities that arises as a limit of a microscopic model when the number of predators goes to infinity. We prove that the process has a unique invariant probability measure and that it is exponentially ergodic. Further on, we rescale the predator dynamics in order to model predators of smaller size. This slow-fast system converges to a community process in which the prey dynamics is averaged on the predator equilibria. This averaged process admits an invariant probability measure which can be computed explicitly. We use numerical simulations to study the convergence of the invariant probability measures of the rescaled processes.</p>

<h2>Ikeda type lift on $\SO(3,n+1)$</h2>
<h3>Henry H. Kim, Takuya Yamauchi</h3>
<p>arXiv:2512.03412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using Ikeda's theory for a compatible family of Eisenstein series, we explicitly construct Ikeda type lifts on the special orthogonal group $G=\SO(3,n+1)$ over $\Q$ with $n\ge 3$ which splits everywhere at finite places. Our lifts are Hecke eigen cusp forms of weight $l$ ($l\ge n+2$, even) and come from elliptic newforms with respect to $\SL_2(\Z)$ which are of weight $l-\frac{n-2}{2}$ when $n$ is even and
  $2l-n+1$ when $n$ is odd.</p>

<h2>A Bayesian Dirichlet Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity Model for Forecasting Currency Shares</h2>
<h3>Harrison Katz, Robert E. Weiss</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.14132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze daily Airbnb service-fee shares across eleven settlement currencies, a compositional series that shows bursts of volatility after shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Standard Dirichlet time series models assume constant precision and therefore miss these episodes. We introduce B-DARMA-DARCH, a Bayesian Dirichlet autoregressive moving average model with a Dirichlet ARCH component, which lets the precision parameter follow an ARMA recursion. The specification preserves the Dirichlet likelihood so forecasts remain valid compositions while capturing clustered volatility. Simulations and out-of-sample tests show that B-DARMA-DARCH lowers forecast error and improves interval calibration relative to Dirichlet ARMA and log-ratio VARMA benchmarks, providing a concise framework for settings where both the level and the volatility of proportions matter.</p>
