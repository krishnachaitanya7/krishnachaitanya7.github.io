<h2>Improved impedance inversion by the iterated graph Laplacian</h2>

<p>arXiv:2404.16324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a data-adaptive inversion method that integrates classical or deep learning-based approaches with iterative graph Laplacian regularization, specifically targeting acoustic impedance inversion - a critical task in seismic exploration. Our method initiates from an impedance estimate derived using either traditional inversion techniques or neural network-based methods. This initial estimate guides the construction of a graph Laplacian operator, effectively capturing structural characteristics of the impedance profile. Utilizing a Tikhonov-inspired variational framework with this graph-informed prior, our approach iteratively updates and refines the impedance estimate while continuously recalibrating the graph Laplacian. This iterative refinement shows rapid convergence, increased accuracy, and enhanced robustness to noise compared to initial reconstructions alone. Extensive validation performed on synthetic and real seismic datasets across varying noise levels confirms the effectiveness of our method. Performance evaluations include four initial inversion methods: two classical techniques and two neural networks - previously established in the literature.</p>

<h2>Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction via Rule-Regularized Heteroscedastic Deep Classification</h2>

<p>arXiv:2504.13111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page: https://kumarmanas.github.io/SHIFT/.</p>
