Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play an important role in various applications, where precise trajectory tracking is crucial. However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters. Through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to SOTA methods, it improves the position accuracy by 24.7% to 42.9%, and the angular accuracy by 40.9% to 78.4%.</p>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the normal mean inference problem, which involves testing multiple means of normal random variables with heteroscedastic variances. Most existing empirical Bayes methods for this setting are developed under restrictive assumptions, such as the scaled inverse-chi-squared prior for variances and unimodality for the non-null mean distribution. However, when either of these assumptions is violated, these methods often fail to control the false discovery rate (FDR) at the target level or suffer from a substantial loss of power. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new empirical Bayes method, gg-Mix, which assumes only independence between the normal means and variances, without imposing any structural restrictions on their distributions. We thoroughly evaluate the FDR control and power of gg-Mix through extensive numerical studies and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing methods. Finally, we apply gg-Mix to three real data examples to further illustrate the practical advantages of our approach.</p>
