<h2>Ekedahl-Oort types of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-covers in characteristic $2$</h2>
<h3>Jeremy Booher, Steven R. Groen, Joe Kramer-Miller</h3>
<p>arXiv:2511.02733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study the Ekedahl-Oort types of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-Galois covers $\pi:Y \to X$ in characteristic two. When the base curve $X$ is ordinary, we show that the Ekedahl-Oort type of $Y$ is completely determined by the genus of $X$ and the ramification of $\pi$. For a general base curve $X$, we prove bounds on the Ekedahl-Oort depending on the Ekedahl-Oort type of $X$ and the ramification of $\pi$. Along the way, we develop a theory of \emph{enhanced differentials of the second kind}. This theory allows us to study algebraic de Rham cohomology in any characteristic by working directly with differentials, in contrast to the standard \v{C}ech resolution.</p>

<h2>Credal Concept Bottleneck Models: Structural Separation of Epistemic and Aleatoric Uncertainty</h2>
<h3>Tanmoy Mukherjee, Marius Kloft, Pierre Marquis, Zied Bouraoui</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.11219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decomposing predictive uncertainty into epistemic (model ignorance) and aleatoric (data ambiguity) components is central to reliable decision making, yet most methods estimate both from the same predictive distribution. Recent empirical and theoretical results show these estimates are typically strongly correlated, so changes in predictive spread simultaneously affect both components and blur their semantics. We propose a credal-set formulation in which uncertainty is represented as a set of predictive distributions, so that epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty correspond to distinct geometric properties: the size of the set versus the noise within its elements. We instantiate this idea in a Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with two disjoint uncertainty heads trained by disjoint objectives and non-overlapping gradient paths, yielding separation by construction rather than post hoc decomposition. Across multi-annotator benchmarks, our approach reduces the correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by over an order of magnitude compared to standard methods, while improving the alignment of epistemic uncertainty with prediction error and aleatoric uncertainty with ground-truth ambiguity.</p>

<h2>Surface impedance inference via neural fields and sparse acoustic data obtained by a compact array</h2>

<p>arXiv:2602.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standardized laboratory characterizations for absorbing materials rely on idealized sound field assumptions, which deviate largely from real-life conditions. Consequently, \emph{in-situ} acoustic characterization has become essential for accurate diagnosis and virtual prototyping. We propose a physics-informed neural field that reconstructs local, near-surface broadband sound fields from sparse pressure samples to directly infer complex surface impedance. A parallel, multi-frequency architecture enables a broadband impedance retrieval within runtimes on the order of seconds to minutes. To validate the method, we developed a compact microphone array with low hardware complexity. Numerical verifications and laboratory experiments demonstrate accurate impedance retrieval with a small number of sensors under realistic conditions. We further showcase the approach in a vehicle cabin to provide practical guidance on measurement locations that avoid strong interference. Here, we show that this approach offers a robust means of characterizing \emph{in-situ} boundary conditions for architectural and automotive acoustics.</p>

<h2>CAAL: Confidence-Aware Active Learning for Heteroscedastic Atmospheric Regression</h2>
<h3>Fei Jiang, Jiyang Xia, Junjie Yu, Mingfei Sun, Hugh Coe, David Topping, Dantong Liu, Zhenhui Jessie Li, Zhonghua Zheng</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the impacts of air pollution on health and climate relies on key atmospheric particle properties such as toxicity and hygroscopicity. However, these properties typically require complex observational techniques or expensive particle-resolved numerical simulations, limiting the availability of labeled data. We therefore estimate these hard-to-measure particle properties from routinely available observations (e.g., air pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions). Because routine observations only indirectly reflect particle composition and structure, the mapping from routine observations to particle properties is noisy and input-dependent, yielding a heteroscedastic regression setting. With a limited and costly labeling budget, the central challenge is to select which samples to measure or simulate. While active learning is a natural approach, most acquisition strategies rely on predictive uncertainty. Under heteroscedastic noise, this signal conflates reducible epistemic uncertainty with irreducible aleatoric uncertainty, causing limited budgets to be wasted in noise-dominated regions. To address this challenge, we propose a confidence-aware active learning framework (CAAL) for efficient and robust sample selection in heteroscedastic settings. CAAL consists of two components: a decoupled uncertainty-aware training objective that separately optimises the predictive mean and noise level to stabilise uncertainty estimation, and a confidence-aware acquisition function that dynamically weights epistemic uncertainty using predicted aleatoric uncertainty as a reliability signal. Experiments on particle-resolved numerical simulations and real atmospheric observations show that CAAL consistently outperforms standard AL baselines. The proposed framework provides a practical and general solution for the efficient expansion of high-cost atmospheric particle property databases.</p>

<h2>Pedagogically-Inspired Data Synthesis for Language Model Knowledge Distillation</h2>
<h3>Bowei He, Yankai Chen, Xiaokun Zhang, Linghe Kong, Philip S. Yu, Xue Liu, Chen Ma</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.12172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<h2>Towards Dynamic Quadrupedal Gaits: A Symmetry-Guided RL Hierarchy Enables Free Gait Transitions at Varying Speeds</h2>
<h3>Jiayu Ding, Xulin Chen, Garrett E. Katz, Zhenyu Gan</h3>
<p>arXiv:2510.10455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit a wide range of viable gaits, but generating specific footfall sequences often requires laborious expert tuning of numerous variables, such as touch-down and lift-off events and holonomic constraints for each leg. This paper presents a unified reinforcement learning framework for generating versatile quadrupedal gaits by leveraging the intrinsic symmetries and velocity-period relationship of dynamic legged systems. We propose a symmetry-guided reward function design that incorporates temporal, morphological, and time-reversal symmetries. By focusing on preserved symmetries and natural dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for predefined trajectories, enabling smooth transitions between diverse locomotion patterns such as trotting, bounding, half-bounding, and galloping. Implemented on the Unitree Go2 robot, our method demonstrates robust performance across a range of speeds in both simulations and hardware tests, significantly improving gait adaptability without extensive reward tuning or explicit foot placement control. This work provides insights into dynamic locomotion strategies and underscores the crucial role of symmetries in robotic gait design.</p>
