Abstract: Nonlinear mathematical models introduce the relation between various physical and biological interactions present in nature. One of the most famous models is the Lotka-Volterra model which defined the interaction between predator and prey species present in nature. However, predators, scavengers, and prey populations coexist in a natural system where scavengers can additionally rely on the dead bodies of predators present in the system. Keeping this in mind, the formulation and simulation of the predator prey scavenger model is introduced in this paper. For the predation response, respective prey species are assumed to have Holling's functional response of type III. The proposed model is tested for various simulations and is found to be showing satisfactory results in different scenarios. After simulations, the American forest dataset is taken for parameter estimation which imitates the real-world case. For parameter estimation, a physics-informed deep neural network is used with the Adam backpropagation method which prevents the avalanche effect in trainable parameters updation. For neural networks, mean square error and physics-informed informed error are considered. After the neural network, the hence-found parameters are fine-tuned using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Finally, the hence-found parameters using a natural dataset are tested for stability using Jacobian stability analysis. Future research work includes minimization of error induced by parameters, bifurcation analysis, and sensitivity analysis of the parameters.</p>

<h2>CPFI-EIT: A CNN-PINN Framework for Full-Inverse Electrical Impedance Tomography on Non-Smooth Conductivity Distributions</h2>

<p>arXiv:2412.17827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to address the challenging problem of full-inverse electrical impedance tomography (EIT). EIT is a noninvasive imaging technique that reconstructs the spatial distribution of internal conductivity based on boundary voltage measurements from injected currents. This method has applications across medical imaging, multiphase flow detection, and tactile sensing. However, solving EIT involves a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) derived from Maxwell's equations, posing significant computational challenges as an ill-posed inverse problem. Existing PINN approaches primarily address semi-inverse EIT, assuming full access to internal potential data, which limits practical applications in realistic, full-inverse scenarios. Our framework employs a forward CNN-based supervised network to map differential boundary voltage measurements to a discrete potential distribution under fixed Neumann boundary conditions, while an inverse PINN-based unsupervised network enforces PDE constraints for conductivity reconstruction. Instead of traditional automatic differentiation, we introduce discrete numerical differentiation to bridge the forward and inverse networks, effectively decoupling them, enhancing modularity, and reducing computational demands. We validate our framework under realistic conditions, using a 16-electrode setup and rigorous testing on complex conductivity distributions with sharp boundaries, without Gaussian smoothing. This approach demonstrates robust flexibility and improved applicability in full-inverse EIT, establishing a practical solution for real-world imaging challenges.</p>
