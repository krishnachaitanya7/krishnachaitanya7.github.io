Abstract: This work introduces a method for preprocessing measurements of electrical impedance tomography to considerably reduce the effect uncertainties in the electrode contacts have on the reconstruction quality, without a need to explicitly estimate the contacts. The idea is to compute the Jacobian matrix of the forward map with respect to the contact strengths and project the electrode measurements and the forward map onto the orthogonal complement of the range of this Jacobian. Using the smoothened complete electrode model as the forward model, it is demonstrated that inverting the resulting projected equation with respect to only the internal conductivity of the examined body results in good quality reconstructions both when resorting to a single step linearization with a smoothness prior and when combining lagged diffusivity iteration with total variation regularization. The quality of the reconstructions is further improved if the range of the employed projection is also orthogonal to that of the Jacobian with respect to the electrode positions. These results hold even if the projections are formed at internal and contact conductivities that significantly differ from the true ones; it is numerically demonstrated that the orthogonal complement of the range of the contact Jacobian is almost independent of the conductivity parameters at which it is evaluated. In particular, our observations introduce a numerical technique for inferring whether a change in the electrode measurements is caused by a change in the internal conductivity or alterations in the electrode contacts, which has potential applications, e.g., in bedside monitoring of stroke patients. The ideas are tested both on simulated data and on real-world water tank measurements with adjustable contact resistances.</p>

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative method for predicting shape errors in 5-axis machining using graph neural networks. The graph structure is defined with nodes representing workpiece surface points and edges denoting the neighboring relationships. The dataset encompasses data from a material removal simulation, process data, and post-machining quality information. Experimental results show that the presented approach can generalize the shape error prediction for the investigated workpiece geometry. Moreover, by modelling spatial and temporal connections within the workpiece, the approach handles a low number of labels compared to non-graphical methods such as Support Vector Machines.</p>
