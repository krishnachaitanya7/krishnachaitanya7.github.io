Abstract: As inverter-based loads and energy sources become increasingly prevalent, accurate line impedance estimation between inverters and the grid is essential for optimizing performance and enhancing control strategies. This paper presents a non-invasive estimation algorithm that avoids signal injection, based on the Variable Direction Forgetting Recursive Least Squares (VDF-RLS) method. The method uses measurement data that is local to the inverter. It proposes a specific method for determining rotational frequency for direct-quadrature (dq) coordinate frame in which data is collected, which ensures a simpler and more accurate estimation. This method is enabled by a secondary Phase Locked Loop (PLL) which appropriately attenuates the effects of variations in grid-voltage measurements. By isolating the variation-sensitive q-axis and relying solely on the less sensitive d-axis, the method further minimizes the impact of variations. The estimation method achieves rapid adaptation while ensuring stability in the absence of persistent excitation by selectively discarding outdated data during updates. Results demonstrate significant improvement (as large as 7 times) in estimation of line parameters, when compared to existing approaches such as constant forgetting RLS.</p>

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have emerged as versatile agents capable of locomoting and manipulating in complex environments. Traditional designs typically rely on the robot's inherent body parts or incorporate top-mounted arms for manipulation tasks. However, these configurations may limit the robot's operational dexterity, efficiency and adaptability, particularly in cluttered or constrained spaces. In this work, we present LocoMan, a dexterous quadrupedal robot with a novel morphology to perform versatile manipulation in diverse constrained environments. By equipping a Unitree Go1 robot with two low-cost and lightweight modular 3-DoF loco-manipulators on its front calves, LocoMan leverages the combined mobility and functionality of the legs and grippers for complex manipulation tasks that require precise 6D positioning of the end effector in a wide workspace. To harness the loco-manipulation capabilities of LocoMan, we introduce a unified control framework that extends the whole-body controller (WBC) to integrate the dynamics of loco-manipulators. Through experiments, we validate that the proposed whole-body controller can accurately and stably follow desired 6D trajectories of the end effector and torso, which, when combined with the large workspace from our design, facilitates a diverse set of challenging dexterous loco-manipulation tasks in confined spaces, such as opening doors, plugging into sockets, picking objects in narrow and low-lying spaces, and bimanual manipulation.</p>
