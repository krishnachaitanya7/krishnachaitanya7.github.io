<h2>Enter: Graduated Realism: A Pedagogical Framework for AI-Powered Avatars in Virtual Reality Teacher Training</h2>
<h3>Judson Leroy Dean Haynes IV</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.11890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Reality simulators offer a powerful tool for teacher training, yet the integration of AI-powered student avatars presents a critical challenge: determining the optimal level of avatar realism for effective pedagogy. This literature review examines the evolution of avatar realism in VR teacher training, synthesizes its theoretical implications, and proposes a new pedagogical framework to guide future design. Through a systematic review, this paper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI prototypes. Applying learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, we argue that hyper-realism is not always optimal, as high-fidelity avatars can impose excessive extraneous cognitive load on novices, a stance supported by recent empirical findings. A significant gap exists between the technological drive for photorealism and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning. To address this gap, we propose Graduated Realism, a framework advocating for starting trainees with lower-fidelity avatars and progressively increasing behavioral complexity as skills develop. To make this computationally feasible, we outline a novel single-call architecture, Crazy Slots, which uses a probabilistic engine and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database to generate authentic, real-time responses without the latency and cost of multi-step reasoning models. This review provides evidence-based principles for designing the next generation of AI simulators, arguing that a pedagogically grounded approach to realism is essential for creating scalable and effective teacher education tools.</p>

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.</p>

Abstract: Knee-less bipedal robots like SLIDER have the advantage of ultra-lightweight legs and improved walking energy efficiency compared to traditional humanoid robots. In this paper, we firstly introduce an improved hardware design of the SLIDER bipedal robot with new line-feet and more optimized mass distribution that enables higher locomotion speeds. Secondly, we propose an extended Hybrid Zero Dynamics (eHZD) method, which can be applied to prismatic joint robots like SLIDER. The eHZD method is then used to generate a library of gaits with varying reference velocities in an offline way. Thirdly, a Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to use the pre-generated library to create walking control policies in real-time. This approach allows us to combine the advantages of both HZD (for generating stable gaits with a full-dynamics model) and DRL (for real-time adaptive gait generation). The experimental results show that this approach achieves 150% higher walking velocity than the previous MPC-based approach.</p>
