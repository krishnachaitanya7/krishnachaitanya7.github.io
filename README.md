<h2>Convexification With the Viscocity Term for Electrical Impedance Tomography</h2>
<h3>Michael V. Klibanov, Jingzhi Li, Zhipeng Yang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.07916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A version of the globally convergent convexification numerical method is constructed for the problem of Electrical Impedance Tomography in the 2D case. An important element of this version is the presence of the viscosity term. Global convergence analysis is carried out. Results of numerical experiments are presented.</p>

<h2>Overlap-aware meta-learning attention to enhance hypergraph neural networks for node classification</h2>
<h3>Murong Yang, Shihui Ying, Xin-Jian Xu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.07961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing complex datasets, their practical performance often remains limited. On one hand, existing networks typically employ a single type of attention mechanism, focusing on either structural or feature similarities during message passing. On the other hand, assuming that all nodes in current hypergraph models have the same level of overlap may lead to suboptimal generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework, overlap-aware meta-learning attention for hypergraph neural networks (OMA-HGNN). First, we introduce a hypergraph attention mechanism that integrates both structural and feature similarities. Specifically, we linearly combine their respective losses with weighted factors for the HGNN model. Second, we partition nodes into different tasks based on their diverse overlap levels and develop a multi-task Meta-Weight-Net (MWN) to determine the corresponding weighted factors. Third, we jointly train the internal MWN model with the losses from the external HGNN model and train the external model with the weighted factors from the internal model. To evaluate the effectiveness of OMA-HGNN, we conducted experiments on six real-world datasets and benchmarked its perfor-mance against nine state-of-the-art methods for node classification. The results demonstrate that OMA-HGNN excels in learning superior node representations and outperforms these baselines.</p>

<h2>BIPED: Pedagogically Informed Tutoring System for ESL Education</h2>
<h3>Soonwoo Kwon, Sojung Kim, Minju Park, Seunghyun Lee, Kyuseok Kim</h3>
<p>arXiv:2406.03486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have a great potential to serve as readily available and cost-efficient Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems (CITS) for teaching L2 learners of English. Existing CITS, however, are designed to teach only simple concepts or lack the pedagogical depth necessary to address diverse learning strategies. To develop a more pedagogically informed CITS capable of teaching complex concepts, we construct a BIlingual PEDagogically-informed Tutoring Dataset (BIPED) of one-on-one, human-to-human English tutoring interactions. Through post-hoc analysis of the tutoring interactions, we come up with a lexicon of dialogue acts (34 tutor acts and 9 student acts), which we use to further annotate the collected dataset. Based on a two-step framework of first predicting the appropriate tutor act then generating the corresponding response, we implemented two CITS models using GPT-4 and SOLAR-KO, respectively. We experimentally demonstrate that the implemented models not only replicate the style of human teachers but also employ diverse and contextually appropriate pedagogical strategies.</p>

<h2>AI for Scaling Legal Reform: Mapping and Redacting Racial Covenants in Santa Clara County</h2>
<h3>Faiz Surani, Mirac Suzgun, Vyoma Raman, Christopher D. Manning, Peter Henderson, Daniel E. Ho</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.03888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legal reform can be challenging in light of the volume, complexity, and interdependence of laws, codes, and records. One salient example of this challenge is the effort to restrict and remove racially restrictive covenants, clauses in property deeds that historically barred individuals of specific races from purchasing homes. Despite the Supreme Court holding such racial covenants unenforceable in 1948, they persist in property records across the United States. Many jurisdictions have moved to identify and strike these provisions, including California, which mandated in 2021 that all counties implement such a process. Yet the scale can be overwhelming, with Santa Clara County (SCC) alone having over 24 million property deed documents, making purely manual review infeasible. We present a novel approach to addressing this pressing issue, developed through a partnership with the SCC Clerk-Recorder's Office. First, we leverage an open large language model, finetuned to detect racial covenants with high precision and recall. We estimate that this system reduces manual efforts by 86,500 person hours and costs less than 2% of the cost for a comparable off-the-shelf closed model. Second, we illustrate the County's integration of this model into responsible operational practice, including legal review and the creation of a historical registry, and release our model to assist the hundreds of jurisdictions engaged in similar efforts. Finally, our results reveal distinct periods of utilization of racial covenants, sharp geographic clustering, and the disproportionate role of a small number of developers in maintaining housing discrimination. We estimate that by 1950, one in four properties across the County were subject to racial covenants.</p>
