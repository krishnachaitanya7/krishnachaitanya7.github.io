<h2>Predator-prey models: a review on some recent adaptations</h2>
<h3>\'Erika Diz-Pita, M. Victoria Otero-Espinar</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.16860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last years, predator-prey systems have increased their applications and have given rise to systems which represent more accurately different biological issues that appear in the context of interacting species. Our aim in this paper is to give a state-of-art review of recent predator-prey models which include some interesting characteristics as Allee effect, fear effect, cannibalism and immigration. We compare the qualitative results obtained for each of them, particularly regarding the equilibria, local and global stability, and the existence of limit cycles.</p>

<h2>The empirical median for estimating the common mean of heteroscedastic random variables</h2>
<h3>Sirine Louati</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.16956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of mean estimation in the heteroscedastic setting. In particular, we consider symmetric random variables having the same location parameter and different and unknown scale parameters. Our goal is then to estimate their unknown common location parameter. It is an elementary topic but yet a not very well-studied one since we always make the assumption that the random variables are independent and identically distributed. In this paper, we study the median estimator and we establish upper and lower bounds on its estimation error that are of the same order and that generalize and improve recent results of Devroye et al. and Xia.</p>

<h2>Demonstration of picoRing mouse: an ultra-low-powered wireless mouse ring with ring-to-wristband coil-based sensitive impedance sensing</h2>

<p>arXiv:2501.16674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless mouse rings offer subtle, reliable pointing interactions for wearable computing platforms, but the small battery below 27 mAh in the miniature rings restricts the ring's continuous lifespan to just 1-2 hours due to the power consumption of current low-powered wireless communication like BLE. However, the picoRing mouse addresses this by enabling continuous ring-based mouse interaction with ultra-low-powered ring-to-wristband wireless communication through a coil-based impedance sensing method called semi-passive inductive telemetry. This allows a wristband coil to capture a unique frequency response of a nearby ring coil via sensitive inductive coupling, converting the user's mouse input into the unique frequency response via an 820 uW mouse-driven modulation module. Thus, the picoRing mouse can operate continuously for over 92 hours on a single charge of a 20 mAh battery while supporting subtle scrolling and pressing interactions.</p>

<h2>Conformalized Credal Regions for Classification with Ambiguous Ground Truth</h2>
<h3>Michele Caprio, David Stutz, Shuo Li, Arnaud Doucet</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.04852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An open question in \emph{Imprecise Probabilistic Machine Learning} is how to empirically derive a credal region (i.e., a closed and convex family of probabilities on the output space) from the available data, without any prior knowledge or assumption. In classification problems, credal regions are a tool that is able to provide provable guarantees under realistic assumptions by characterizing the uncertainty about the distribution of the labels. Building on previous work, we show that credal regions can be directly constructed using conformal methods. This allows us to provide a novel extension of classical conformal prediction to problems with ambiguous ground truth, that is, when the exact labels for given inputs are not exactly known. The resulting construction enjoys desirable practical and theoretical properties: (i) conformal coverage guarantees, (ii) smaller prediction sets (compared to classical conformal prediction regions) and (iii) disentanglement of uncertainty sources (epistemic, aleatoric). We empirically verify our findings on both synthetic and real datasets.</p>
