<h2>Dynamical Analysis of a Predator-Prey Model with Additive Allee Effect and Prey Group Defense</h2>

<p>arXiv:2410.13345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a predator-prey model with Allee effect and prey group defense. The model has three equilibrium points i.e. the trivial point, the predator extinction point, and the coexistence point. All equilibrium points are locally asymptotically stable under certain conditions. The Allee effect in this model influences the stability of the equilibrium point. If the Allee effect is weak, then the trivial equilibrium point is unstable. Meanwhile, if the Allee effect is strong, then the trivial equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable. Those mean that a strong Allee effect can lead to the extinction of both populations. Moreover, under weak Allee condition, forward bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation occur at the predator extinction equilibrium point. Meanwhile, a strong Allee effect may induce bistability at both the trivial equilibrium point and the predator extinction equilibrium point. Those mean that prey can survive without the presence of predators, but a strong Allee effect can lead to prey extinction if the population size is very small. To support our analytical findings, we perform some numerical simulations in the final section.</p>

Abstract: Urgent applications like wildfire management and renewable energy generation require precise, localized weather forecasts near the Earth's surface. However, weather forecast products from machine learning or numerical weather models are currently generated on a global regular grid, on which a naive interpolation cannot accurately reflect fine-grained weather patterns close to the ground. In this work, we train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) end-to-end to downscale gridded forecasts to off-grid locations of interest. This multi-modal GNN takes advantage of local historical weather observations (e.g., wind, temperature) to correct the gridded weather forecast at different lead times towards locally accurate forecasts. Each data modality is modeled as a different type of node in the graph. Using message passing, the node at the prediction location aggregates information from its heterogeneous neighbor nodes. Experiments using weather stations across the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range of data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods. Our approach demonstrates how the gap between global large-scale weather models and locally accurate predictions can be bridged to inform localized decision-making.</p>

<h2>Preference Aligned Diffusion Planner for Quadrupedal Locomotion Control</h2>
<h3>Xinyi Yuan, Zhiwei Shang, Zifan Wang, Chenkai Wang, Zhao Shan, Zhenchao Qi, Meixin Zhu, Chenjia Bai, Xuelong Li</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex distributions from large-scale datasets, providing a promising solution for quadrupedal locomotion control. However, offline policy is sensitive to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) states due to the limited state coverage in the datasets. In this work, we propose a two-stage learning framework combining offline learning and online preference alignment for legged locomotion control. Through the offline stage, the diffusion planner learns the joint distribution of state-action sequences from expert datasets without using reward labels. Subsequently, we perform the online interaction in the simulation environment based on the trained offline planer, which significantly addresses the OOD issues and improves the robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel weak preference labeling method without the ground-truth reward or human preferences. The proposed method exhibits superior stability and velocity tracking accuracy in pacing, trotting, and bounding gait under both slow- and high-speed scenarios and can perform zero-shot transfer to the real Unitree Go1 robots.

<h2>Credal Two-Sample Tests of Epistemic Ignorance</h2>
<h3>Siu Lun Chau, Antonin Schrab, Arthur Gretton, Dino Sejdinovic, Krikamol Muandet</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.12921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce credal two-sample testing, a new hypothesis testing framework for comparing credal sets -- convex sets of probability measures where each element captures aleatoric uncertainty and the set itself represents epistemic uncertainty that arises from the modeller's partial ignorance. Classical two-sample tests, which rely on comparing precise distributions, fail to address epistemic uncertainty due to partial ignorance. To bridge this gap, we generalise two-sample tests to compare credal sets, enabling reasoning for equality, inclusion, intersection, and mutual exclusivity, each offering unique insights into the modeller's epistemic beliefs. We formalise these tests as two-sample tests with nuisance parameters and introduce the first permutation-based solution for this class of problems, significantly improving upon existing methods. Our approach properly incorporates the modeller's epistemic uncertainty into hypothesis testing, leading to more robust and credible conclusions, with kernel-based implementations for real-world applications.</p>

Abstract: In recent years, the potential applications of machine learning to Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) have spurred interest in data sets that can be used to develop data-driven tools. This paper introduces a novel dataset recorded during ex vivo pseudo-cholecystectomy procedures on pig livers, utilizing the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). Unlike current datasets, ours bridges a critical gap by offering not only full kinematic data but also capturing all pedal inputs used during the procedure and providing a time-stamped record of the endoscope's movements. Contributed by seven surgeons, this data set introduces a new dimension to surgical robotics research, allowing the creation of advanced models for automating console functionalities. Our work addresses the existing limitation of incomplete recordings and imprecise kinematic data, common in other datasets. By introducing two models, dedicated to predicting clutch usage and camera activation, we highlight the dataset's potential for advancing automation in surgical robotics. The comparison of methodologies and time windows provides insights into the models' boundaries and limitations.</p>

<h2>Adaptive LAD-Based Bootstrap Unit Root Tests under Unconditional Heteroskedasticity</h2>
<h3>Jilin Wu, Ruike Wu, Zhijie Xiao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.13170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores testing unit roots based on least absolute deviations (LAD) regression under unconditional heteroskedasticity. We first derive the asymptotic properties of the LAD estimator for a first-order autoregressive process with the coefficient (local to) unity under unconditional heteroskedasticity and weak dependence, revealing that the limiting distribution of the LAD estimator (consequently the derived test statistics) is closely associated with unknown time-varying variances. To conduct feasible LAD-based unit root tests under heteroskedasticity and serial dependence, we develop an adaptive block bootstrap procedure, which accommodates time-varying volatility and serial dependence, both of unknown forms, to compute critical values for LAD-based tests. The asymptotic validity is established. We then extend the testing procedure to allow for deterministic components. Simulation results indicate that, in the presence of unconditional heteroskedasticity and serial dependence, the classic LAD-based tests demonstrate severe size distortion, whereas the proposed LAD-based bootstrap tests exhibit good size-control capability. Additionally, the newly developed tests show superior testing power in heavy-tailed distributed cases compared to considered benchmarks. Finally, empirical analysis of real effective exchange rates of 16 EU countries is conducted to illustrate the applicability of the newly proposed tests.</p>
