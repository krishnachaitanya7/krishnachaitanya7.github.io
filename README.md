<h2>Singularities in the Ekedahl--Oort stratification</h2>
<h3>Jean-Stefan Koskivirta, Lorenzo La Porta, Stefan Reppen</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.16086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give conceptual and combinatorial criteria for the normality and Cohen--Macaulayness of unions of Ekedahl--Oort strata in the special fiber of abelian type Shimura varieties. For unions of two strata, one of the two having codimension one in the closure of the other, we determine exactly when their union is smooth. We provide explicit numerical criteria for the smoothness of any one-dimensional EO-stratum closure of Shimura varieties. For groups of type $\mathsf{B}_n$, we describe the smooth and normal loci of all EO-strata closures. We construct reduced strata Hasse invariants of explicit weights on EO-strata of codimension at most $n-1$, showing that their Zariski closures are local complete intersections. We also provide a closed form formula for their cycle classes.</p>

<h2>Output Regulation for Impedance Passive Systems with Input Saturation</h2>
<h3>Thavamani Govindaraj, Lassi Paunonen</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider output tracking and disturbance rejection for abstract infinite-dimensional systems with input saturation. We solve the control problem using a control law which consists of a stabilising error feedback term and a feedforward term based on the reference and disturbance signals. We use our results to design control laws for output tracking and disturbance rejection for a two-dimensional heat equation and a one-dimensional wave equation with boundary control and observation.</p>

<h2>Complete systems of solutions, transmutations and Darboux transform for Sturm-Liouville equations in impedance form</h2>
<h3>V\'ictor A. Vicente-Ben\'itez</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the construction of a complete system of functions associated with the Sturm-Liouville equation in impedance form on a finite interval $I$, given an impedance function $a\in L^2(I)$. The system, known as the formal powers, is generated through recursive integration of the impedance function $a$ and its reciprocal. We establish the completeness of this system in the space $L^p$ with the weight function $a^2$. Under additional conditions on $a$, we extend the completeness of this completeness to Sobolev spaces $W^{1,p}(I)$, along with a generalized Taylor formula. We show that the completeness of the formal powers implies key analytic properties for a transmutation operator associated with the Sturm-Liouville equation in impedance form, including the existence of a continuous inverse. Finally, we introduce a formulation of the Darboux-transformed equation and establish a relation between the transmutation operators to the original and transformed equations.</p>

<h2>Investigating Lagrangian Neural Networks for Infinite Horizon Planning in Quadrupedal Locomotion</h2>
<h3>Prakrut Kotecha, Aditya Shirwatkar, Shishir Kolathaya</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.16079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) present a principled and interpretable framework for learning the system dynamics by utilizing inductive biases. While traditional dynamics models struggle with compounding errors over long horizons, LNNs intrinsically preserve the physical laws governing any system, enabling accurate and stable predictions essential for sustainable locomotion. This work evaluates LNNs for infinite horizon planning in quadrupedal robots through four dynamics models: (1) full-order forward dynamics (FD) training and inference, (2) diagonalized representation of Mass Matrix in full order FD, (3) full-order inverse dynamics (ID) training with FD inference, (4) reduced-order modeling via torso centre-of-mass (CoM) dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that LNNs bring improvements in sample efficiency (10x) and superior prediction accuracy (up to 2-10x) compared to baseline methods. Notably, the diagonalization approach of LNNs reduces computational complexity while retaining some interpretability, enabling real-time receding horizon control. These findings highlight the advantages of LNNs in capturing the underlying structure of system dynamics in quadrupeds, leading to improved performance and efficiency in locomotion planning and control. Additionally, our approach achieves a higher control frequency than previous LNN methods, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment on quadrupeds.</p>

<h2>Human2LocoMan: Learning Versatile Quadrupedal Manipulation with Human Pretraining</h2>
<h3>Yaru Niu, Yunzhe Zhang, Mingyang Yu, Changyi Lin, Chenhao Li, Yikai Wang, Yuxiang Yang, Wenhao Yu, Tingnan Zhang, Bingqing Chen, Jonathan Francis, Zhenzhen Li, Jie Tan, Ding Zhao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated impressive locomotion capabilities in complex environments, but equipping them with autonomous versatile manipulation skills in a scalable way remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment imitation learning system for quadrupedal manipulation, leveraging data collected from both humans and LocoMan, a quadruped equipped with multiple manipulation modes. Specifically, we develop a teleoperation and data collection pipeline, which unifies and modularizes the observation and action spaces of the human and the robot. To effectively leverage the collected data, we propose an efficient modularized architecture that supports co-training and pretraining on structured modality-aligned data across different embodiments. Additionally, we construct the first manipulation dataset for the LocoMan robot, covering various household tasks in both unimanual and bimanual modes, supplemented by a corresponding human dataset. We validate our system on six real-world manipulation tasks, where it achieves an average success rate improvement of 41.9% overall and 79.7% under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings compared to the baseline. Pretraining with human data contributes a 38.6% success rate improvement overall and 82.7% under OOD settings, enabling consistently better performance with only half the amount of robot data.
