<p>arXiv:2412.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To develop a fast image reconstruction method for stroke monitoring with electrical impedance tomography with image quality comparable to computationally expensive nonlinear model-based methods. Methods: A post-processing approach with graph convolutional networks is employed. Utilizing the flexibility of the graph setting, a graph U-net is trained on linear difference reconstructions from 2D simulated stroke data and applied to fully 3D images from realistic simulated and experimental data. An additional network, trained on 3D vs. 2D images, is also considered for comparison. Results: Post-processing the linear difference reconstructions through the graph U-net significantly improved the image quality, resulting in images comparable to, or better than, the time-intensive nonlinear reconstruction method (a few minutes vs. several hours). Conclusion: Pairing a fast reconstruction method, such as linear difference imaging, with post-processing through a graph U-net provided significant improvements, at a negligible computational cost. Training in the graph framework vs classic pixel-based setting (CNN) allowed the ability to train on 2D cross-sectional images and process 3D volumes providing a nearly 50x savings in data simulation costs with no noticeable loss in quality. Significance: The proposed approach of post-processing a linear difference reconstruction with the graph U-net could be a feasible approach for on-line monitoring of hemorrhagic stroke.</p>

<h2>Fine-grained graph representation learning for heterogeneous mobile networks with attentive fusion and contrastive learning</h2>

<p>arXiv:2412.07809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI becomes increasingly vital for telecom industry, as the burgeoning complexity of upcoming mobile communication networks places immense pressure on network operators. While there is a growing consensus that intelligent network self-driving holds the key, it heavily relies on expert experience and knowledge extracted from network data. In an effort to facilitate convenient analytics and utilization of wireless big data, we introduce the concept of knowledge graphs into the field of mobile networks, giving rise to what we term as wireless data knowledge graphs (WDKGs). However, the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of communication networks renders manual WDKG construction both prohibitively costly and error-prone, presenting a fundamental challenge. In this context, we propose an unsupervised data-and-model driven graph structure learning (DMGSL) framework, aimed at automating WDKG refinement and updating. Tackling WDKG heterogeneity involves stratifying the network into homogeneous layers and refining it at a finer granularity. Furthermore, to capture WDKG dynamics effectively, we segment the network into static snapshots based on the coherence time and harness the power of recurrent neural networks to incorporate historical information. Extensive experiments conducted on the established WDKG demonstrate the superiority of the DMGSL over the baselines, particularly in terms of node classification accuracy.</p>

<p>arXiv:2412.08270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The musculoskeletal humanoid has many benefits that human beings have, but the modeling of its complex flexible body is difficult. Although we have developed an online acquisition method of the nonlinear relationship between joints and muscles, we could not completely match the actual robot and its self-body image. When realizing a certain task, the direct relationship between the control input and task state needs to be learned. So, we construct a neural network representing the time-series relationship between the control input and task state, and realize the intended task state by applying the network to a real-time control. In this research, we conduct accelerator pedal control experiments as one application, and verify the effectiveness of this study.</p>

<h2>Solving the Electrical Impedance Tomography Problem with a DeepONet Type Neural Network: Theory and Application</h2>
<h3>Anuj Abhishek, Thilo Strauss</h3>
<p>arXiv:2407.17182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the non-invasive medical imaging modality of Electrical Impedance Tomography, where the problem is to recover the conductivity in a medium from a set of data that arises out of a current-to-voltage map (Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator) defined on the boundary of the medium. We formulate this inverse problem as an operator-learning problem where the goal is to learn the implicitly defined operator-to-function map between the space of Neumann-to-Dirichlet operators to the space of admissible conductivities. Subsequently, we use an operator-learning architecture, popularly called DeepONets, to learn this operator-to-function map. Thus far, most of the operator learning architectures have been implemented to learn operators between function spaces. In this work, we generalize the earlier works and use a DeepONet to actually {learn an operator-to-function} map. We provide a Universal Approximation Theorem type result which guarantees that this implicitly defined operator-to-function map between the space of Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator to the space of conductivity function can be approximated to an arbitrary degree using such a DeepONet. Furthermore, we provide a computational implementation of our proposed approach and compare it against a standard baseline. We show that the proposed approach achieves good reconstructions and outperforms the baseline method in our experiments.</p>

<h2>SStaGCN: Simplified stacking based graph convolutional networks</h2>
<h3>Jia Cai, Zhilong Xiong, Shaogao Lv</h3>
<p>arXiv:2111.08228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN) is a powerful model studied broadly in various graph structural data learning tasks. However, to mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon, and deal with heterogeneous graph structural data, the design of GCN model remains a crucial issue to be investigated. In this paper, we propose a novel GCN called SStaGCN (Simplified stacking based GCN) by utilizing the ideas of stacking and aggregation, which is an adaptive general framework for tackling heterogeneous graph data. Specifically, we first use the base models of stacking to extract the node features of a graph. Subsequently, aggregation methods such as mean, attention and voting techniques are employed to further enhance the ability of node features extraction. Thereafter, the node features are considered as inputs and fed into vanilla GCN model. Furthermore, theoretical generalization bound analysis of the proposed model is explicitly given. Extensive experiments on $3$ public citation networks and another $3$ heterogeneous tabular data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art GCNs. Notably, the proposed SStaGCN can efficiently mitigate the over-smoothing problem of GCN.</p>
