<p>arXiv:2405.08799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Yoneda embedding extends to an $(\infty,2)$-natural transformation. Furthermore, as such, it is uniquely determined by its value at the trivial $\infty$-category. We also study the naturality of the Yoneda lemma in its arguments, showing that it is an isomorphism of $(\infty,2)$-natural transformations.</p>

<h2>Multiple parameter bifurcations in a modified Gower-Leslie predator-prey system with addictive Allee effect</h2>

<p>arXiv:2505.09126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a modified Leslie-Gower type predator-prey model with Holling I functional response and addictive Allee effect in prey. It is shown that the highest codimension of a nilpotent cusp 4, and the model can undergo degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 4. Besides, when the model has a center-type equilibrium, we show that the model can admit five limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation. Our results indicate that addictive Allee effect can induce not only richer dynamics and bifurcations, but also the coextinction of both populations with some positive initial densities. Finally, numerical simulations, including three limit cycles and four limit cycles, are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</p>

<h2>Multi-Touch and Bending Perception Using Electrical Impedance Tomography for Robotics</h2>
<h3>Haofeng Chen, Bedrich Himmel, Bin Li, Xiaojie Wang, Matej Hoffmann</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.13048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) offers a promising solution for distributed tactile sensing with minimal wiring and full-surface coverage in robotic applications. However, EIT-based tactile sensors face significant challenges during surface bending. Deformation alters the baseline impedance distribution and couples with touch-induced conductivity variations, complicating signal interpretation. To address this challenge, we present a novel sensing framework that integrates a deep neural network for interaction state classification with a dynamic adaptive reference strategy to decouple touch and deformation signals, while a data-driven regression model translates EIT voltage changes into continuous bending angles. The framework is validated using a magnetic hydrogel composite sensor that conforms to bendable surfaces. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves precise and robust bending angle estimation, high accuracy in distinguishing touch, bending, and idle states, and significantly improves touch localization quality under bending deformation compared to conventional fixed-reference methods. Real-time experiments confirm the system's capability to reliably detect multi-touch interactions and track bending angles across varying deformation conditions. This work paves the way for flexible EIT-based robotic skins capable of rich multimodal sensing in robotics and human-robot interaction.</p>

<h2>Understanding Pedagogical Content Knowledge of Data Science Instructors: An Inaugural Framework</h2>
<h3>Sinem Demirci, Mine Do\u{g}ucu, Andrew Zieffler, Joshua M. Rosenberg</h3>
<p>arXiv:2508.14009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As data science emerges as a distinct academic discipline, introductory data science (IDS) courses have also drawn attention to their role in providing foundational knowledge of data science to students. IDS courses not only help students transition to higher education but also expose students to the field, often for the first time. They are often taught by instructors without formal training in data science or pedagogy, creating a unique context for examining their pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). This study explores IDS instructors' PCK, particularly how instructors' varied backgrounds interact with their instructional practices. Employing empirical phenomenological methodology, we conducted semi-structured interviews to understand the nature of their PCK. Comparing instructors' PCK was inherently challenging due to their diverse backgrounds and teaching contexts. Prior experiences played a central role in shaping participants' instructional choices. Their perceptions regarding the goals and rationale for teaching data science reflected three distinct orientations. Instructors also acknowledged students entering IDS courses often brought preconceived notions that shaped their learning experiences. Despite the absence of national guidelines, participants demonstrated notable overlap in foundational IDS content, though some instructors felt less confident with advanced or specialized topics. Additionally, instructors commonly employed formative and summative assessment approaches, though few explicitly labeled their practices using these terms. The findings highlight key components of PCK in IDS and offer insights into supporting instructor development through targeted training and curriculum design. This work contributes to ongoing efforts to build capacity in data science education and expand the scope of PCK research into new interdisciplinary domains.</p>
