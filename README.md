<h2>A Teleoperation System with Impedance Control and Disturbance Observer for Robot-Assisted Rehabilitation</h2>

<p>arXiv:2412.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical movement therapy is a crucial method of rehabilitation aimed at reinstating mobility among patients facing motor dysfunction due to neurological conditions or accidents. Such therapy is usually featured as patient-specific, repetitive, and labor-intensive. The conventional method, where therapists collaborate with patients to conduct repetitive physical training, proves strenuous due to these characteristics. The concept of robot-assisted rehabilitation, assisting therapists with robotic systems, has gained substantial popularity. However, building such systems presents challenges, such as diverse task demands, uncertainties in dynamic models, and safety issues. To address these concerns, in this paper, we proposed a bilateral teleoperation system for rehabilitation. The control scheme of the system is designed as an integrated framework of impedance control and disturbance observer where the former can ensure compliant human-robot interaction without the need for force sensors while the latter can compensate for dynamic uncertainties when only a roughly identified dynamic model is available. Furthermore, the scheme allows free switching between tracking tasks and physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). The presented system can execute a wide array of pre-defined trajectories with varying patterns, adaptable to diverse needs. Moreover, the system can capture therapists' demonstrations, replaying them as many times as necessary. The effectiveness of the teleoperation system is experimentally evaluated and demonstrated.</p>

<h2>Synthetic graphs for link prediction benchmarking</h2>
<h3>Alexey Vlaskin, Eduardo G. Altmann</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting missing links in complex networks requires algorithms that are able to explore statistical regularities in the existing data. Here we investigate the interplay between algorithm efficiency and network structures through the introduction of suitably-designed synthetic graphs. We propose a family of random graphs that incorporates both micro-scale motifs and meso-scale communities, two ubiquitous structures in complex networks. A key contribution is the derivation of theoretical upper bounds for link prediction performance in our synthetic graphs, allowing us to estimate the predictability of the task and obtain an improved assessment of the performance of any method. Our results on the performance of classical methods (e.g., Stochastic Block Models, Node2Vec,GraphSage) show that the performance of all methods correlate with the theoretical predictability, that no single method is universally superior, and that each of the methods exploit different characteristics known to exist in large classes of networks. Our findings underline the need for careful consideration of graph structure when selecting a link prediction method and emphasize the value of comparing performance against synthetic benchmarks. We provide open-source code for generating these synthetic graphs, enabling further research on link prediction methods.</p>

<h2>Is uniform expressivity too restrictive? Towards efficient expressivity of graph neural networks</h2>
<h3>Sammy Khalife, Josu\'e Tonelli-Cueto</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.01910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniform expressivity guarantees that a Graph Neural Network (GNN) can express a query without the parameters depending on the size of the input graphs. This property is desirable in applications in order to have number of trainable parameters that is independent of the size of the input graphs. Uniform expressivity of the two variable guarded fragment (GC2) of first order logic is a well-celebrated result for Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) GNNs [Barcelo & al., 2020]. In this article, we prove that uniform expressivity of GC2 queries is not possible for GNNs with a wide class of Pfaffian activation functions (including the sigmoid and tanh), answering a question formulated by [Grohe, 2021]. We also show that despite these limitations, many of those GNNs can still efficiently express GC2 queries in a way that the number of parameters remains logarithmic on the maximal degree of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a log-log dependency on the degree is achievable for a certain choice of activation function. This shows that uniform expressivity can be successfully relaxed by covering large graphs appearing in practical applications. Our experiments illustrates that our theoretical estimates hold in practice.</p>
