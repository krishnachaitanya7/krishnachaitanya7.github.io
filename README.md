<h2>Full-Covariance Chemical Langevin Predator--Prey Diffusion with Absorbing Boundaries</h2>

<p>arXiv:2602.05336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many stochastic Rosenzweig--MacArthur predator--prey models inject ad hoc independent (diagonal) noise and therefore cannot encode the event-level coupling created by predation and biomass conversion. We derive an absorbed, fully mechanistic diffusion approximation and its extinction structure from a continuous-time Markov chain on $\mathbb N_0^2$ with four reaction channels: prey birth, prey competition death, predator death, and a coupled predation--conversion event. Absorbing coordinate axes are imposed to represent the irreversibility of demographic extinction. Under Kurtz density-dependent scaling, the law-of-large-numbers limit recovers the classical RM ODE, while central-limit scaling yields a chemical-Langevin diffusion with explicit drift and full state-dependent covariance. A distinctive signature is the strictly negative cross-covariance $\Sigma_{12}(N,P)=-mNP/(1+N)$ induced solely by the predation--conversion increment $(-1,1)$. We define the absorbed It\^o SDE by freezing trajectories at the first boundary hit and prove strong well-posedness, non-explosion, and moment bounds up to absorption. Extinction has positive probability from every interior state, and predator extinction is almost sure when $m\le c$.</p>

<h2>TOLEBI: Learning Fault-Tolerant Bipedal Locomotion via Online Status Estimation and Fallibility Rewards</h2>

<p>arXiv:2602.05596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing employment of learning algorithms in robotic applications, research on reinforcement learning for bipedal locomotion has become a central topic for humanoid robotics. While recently published contributions achieve high success rates in locomotion tasks, scarce attention has been devoted to the development of methods that enable to handle hardware faults that may occur during the locomotion process. However, in real-world settings, environmental disturbances or sudden occurrences of hardware faults might yield severe consequences. To address these issues, this paper presents TOLEBI (A faulT-tOlerant Learning framEwork for Bipedal locomotIon) that handles faults on the robot during operation. Specifically, joint locking, power loss and external disturbances are injected in simulation to learn fault-tolerant locomotion strategies. In addition to transferring the learned policy to the real robot via sim-to-real transfer, an online joint status module incorporated. This module enables to classify joint conditions by referring to the actual observations at runtime under real-world conditions. The validation experiments conducted both in real-world and simulation with the humanoid robot TOCABI highlight the applicability of the proposed approach. To our knowledge, this manuscript provides the first learning-based fault-tolerant framework for bipedal locomotion, thereby fostering the development of efficient learning methods in this field.</p>
