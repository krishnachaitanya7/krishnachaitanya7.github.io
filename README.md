Abstract: In this paper, we consider a partial deconvolution kernel estimator for nonparametric regression when some covariates are measured with error while others are observed without error. We focus on a general and realistic setting in which the measurement errors are heteroscedastic. We propose a kernel-based estimator of the regression function in this framework and show that it achieves the optimal convergence rate under suitable regularity conditions. The finite-sample performance of the proposed estimator is illustrated through simulation studies.</p>
