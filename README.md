<h2>Neumann series of Bessel functions for the solutions of the Sturm-Liouville equation in impedance form and related boundary value problems</h2>
<h3>Abigail G. M\'arquez-Hern\'andez, V\'ictor A. Vicente-Ben\'itez</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Neumann series of spherical Bessel functions representation for solutions of the Sturm--Liouville equation in impedance form \[ (\kappa(x)u')' + \lambda \kappa(x)u = 0,\quad 0 < x < L, \] in the case where $\kappa \in W^{1,2}(0,L)$ and has no zeros on the interval of interest. The $x$-dependent coefficients of this representation can be constructed explicitly by means of a simple recursive integration procedure. Moreover, we derive bounds for the truncation error, which are uniform whenever the spectral parameter $\rho=\sqrt{\lambda}$ satisfies a condition of the form $|\operatorname{Im}\rho|\leq C$. Based on these representations, we develop a numerical method for solving spectral problems that enables the computation of eigenvalues with non-deteriorating accuracy.</p>

<h2>On the effects of protection zone and directed population flux in prey-predator dynamics</h2>
<h3>Kousuke Kuto, Kazuhiro Oeda</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a spatial predator-prey model in which prey can enter a protection zone (refuge) inaccessible to predators, while predators exhibit directed movement toward prey-rich regions. The directed movement is modeled by a far-sighted population flux motivated by classical movement rules, in contrast to the more commonly analyzed near-sighted chemotaxis-type mechanisms. We first establish local-in-time well-posedness for the corresponding nonstationary problem under Neumann boundary conditions, despite the discontinuity induced by the refuge interface. We then investigate the stationary problem, focusing on how the coexistence states emerge and organize globally in parameter space. In particular, we identify the bifurcation threshold for positive steady states from semitrivial predator-only equilibria, and describe the global continuation of the resulting branches. Our analysis reveals that strong directed movement can induce turning-point structures and multiplicity of coexistence steady states, highlighting a nontrivial interplay between spatial protection and predator movement behavior.</p>

<h2>FeedEval: Pedagogically Aligned Evaluation of LLM-Generated Essay Feedback</h2>
<h3>Seongyeub Chu, Jongwoo Kim, Munyong Yi</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Going beyond the prediction of numerical scores, recent research in automated essay scoring has increasingly emphasized the generation of high-quality feedback that provides justification and actionable guidance. To mitigate the high cost of expert annotation, prior work has commonly relied on LLM-generated feedback to train essay assessment models. However, such feedback is often incorporated without explicit quality validation, resulting in the propagation of noise in downstream applications. To address this limitation, we propose FeedEval, an LLM-based framework for evaluating LLM-generated essay feedback along three pedagogically grounded dimensions: specificity, helpfulness, and validity. FeedEval employs dimension-specialized LLM evaluators trained on datasets curated in this study to assess multiple feedback candidates and select high-quality feedback for downstream use. Experiments on the ASAP++ benchmark show that FeedEval closely aligns with human expert judgments and that essay scoring models trained with FeedEval-filtered high-quality feedback achieve superior scoring performance. Furthermore, revision experiments using small LLMs show that the high-quality feedback identified by FeedEval leads to more effective essay revisions. We will release our code and curated datasets upon accepted.</p>

<h2>Prediction of Cellular Malignancy Using Electrical Impedance Signatures and Supervised Machine Learning</h2>
<h3>Shadeeb Hossain</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.04478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bioelectrical properties of cells such as relative permittivity, conductivity, and characteristic time constants vary significantly between healthy and malignant cells across different frequencies. These distinctions provide a promising foundation for diagnostic and classification applications. This study systematically reviewed 33 scholarly articles to compile datasets of quantitative bioelectric parameters and evaluated their utility in predictive modeling. Three supervised machine learning algorithms- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were implemented and tuned using key hyperparameters to assess classification performance. Model effectiveness was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics. Results demonstrate that Random Forest achieved the highest predictive accuracy of ~ 90% when configured with a maximum depth of 4 and 100 estimators. These findings highlight the potential of integrating bioelectrical property analysis with machine learning for improved diagnostic decision-making. Similarly, for KNN and SVM, the F1 score peaked at approximately 78% and 76.5%, respectively. Future work will explore incorporating additional discriminative features, leveraging stimulated datasets, and optimizing hyperparameter through advanced search strategies. Ultimately, hardware prototype with embedded micro-electrodes and real-time control systems could pave the path for practical diagnostic tools capable of in-situ cell classification.</p>
