<h2>M-dissipative generalized impedance boundary conditions, discrete spectra, and pointwise multipliers between fractional Sobolev spaces</h2>
<h3>Illya M. Karabash</h3>
<p>arXiv:2502.00493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies properties of acoustic operators in bounded Lipschitz domains $\Omega$ with m-dissipative generalized impedance boundary conditions. We prove that such acoustic operators have a compact resolvent if and only if the impedance operator from the trace space $H^{1/2} (\partial \Omega)$ to the other trace space $H^{-1/2} (\partial \Omega)$ is compact. This result is applied to the question of the discreteness of the spectrum and to the particular cases of damping and impedance boundary conditions. The method of the paper is based on abstract results written in terms of boundary tuples and is applicable to other types of wave equations.</p>

<h2>Effects and biological consequences of the predator-mediated apparent competition I: ODE models</h2>
<h3>Yuan Lou, Weirun Tao, Zhi-An Wang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2502.00410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to investigating the effects and biological consequences of the predator-mediated apparent competition based on a two prey species (one is native and the other is invasive) and one predator model with Holling type I and II functional response functions. Through the analytical results and case studies alongside numerical simulations, we find that the initial mass of the invasive prey species, capture rates of prey species, and the predator's mortality rate are all important factors determining the success/failure of invasions and the species coexistence/extinction. The global dynamics can be completely classified for the Holling type I functional response function, but can only be partially determined for the Holling type II functional response function. For the Holling type I response function, we find that whether the invasive prey species can successfully invade to promote the predator-mediated apparent competition is entirely determined by the capture rates of prey species. If the Holling type II response function is applied, then the dynamics are more complicated. First, if two prey species have the same ecological characteristics, then the initial mass of the invasive prey species is the key factor determining the success/failure of the invasion and hence the effect of the predator-mediated apparent competition. Whereas if two prey species have different ecological characteristics, say different capture rates, then the success of the invasion no longer depends on the initial mass of the invasive prey species, but on the capture rates. In all cases, if the invasion succeeds, then the predator-mediated apparent competition's effectiveness essentially depends on the predator's mortality rate.</p>

<p>arXiv:2502.00944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown promising results for several domains such as materials science, chemistry, and the social sciences. GNN models often contain millions of parameters, and like other neural network (NN) models, are often fed only a fraction of the graphs that make up the training dataset in batches to update model parameters. The effect of batching algorithms on training time and model performance has been thoroughly explored for NNs but not yet for GNNs. We analyze two different batching algorithms for graph based models, namely static and dynamic batching. We use the Jraph library built on JAX to perform our experiments, where we compare the two batching methods for two datasets, the QM9 dataset of small molecules and the AFLOW materials database. Our experiments show that significant training time savings can be found from changing the batching algorithm, but the fastest algorithm depends on the data, model, batch size and number of training steps run. Experiments show no significant difference in model learning between the algorithms.</p>

<h2>Benchmarking Different QP Formulations and Solvers for Dynamic Quadrupedal Walking</h2>
<h3>Franek Stark, Jakob Middelberg, Dennis Mronga, Shubham Vyas, Frank Kirchner</h3>
<p>arXiv:2502.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic Programs (QPs) are widely used in the control of walking robots, especially in Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Whole-Body Control (WBC). In both cases, the controller design requires the formulation of a QP and the selection of a suitable QP solver, both requiring considerable time and expertise. While computational performance benchmarks exist for QP solvers, studies comparing optimal combinations of computational hardware (HW), QP formulation, and solver performance are lacking. In this work, we compare dense and sparse QP formulations, and multiple solving methods on different HW architectures, focusing on their computational efficiency in dynamic walking of four legged robots using MPC. We introduce the Solve Frequency per Watt (SFPW) as a performance measure to enable a cross hardware comparison of the efficiency of QP solvers. We also benchmark different QP solvers for WBC that we use for trajectory stabilization in quadrupedal walking. As a result, this paper provides recommendations for the selection of QP formulations and solvers for different HW architectures in walking robots and indicates which problems should be devoted the greater technical effort in this domain in future.</p>

<h2>Discovering robust biomarkers of psychiatric disorders from resting-state functional MRI via graph neural networks: A systematic review</h2>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a popular tool for modelling functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. Many recent studies have reported significant improvements in disorder classification performance via more sophisticated GNN designs and highlighted salient features that could be potential biomarkers of the disorder. However, existing methods of evaluating their robustness are often limited to cross-referencing with existing literature, which is a subjective and inconsistent process. In this review, we provide an overview of how GNN and model explainability techniques (specifically, feature attributors) have been applied to fMRI datasets for disorder prediction tasks, with an emphasis on evaluating the robustness of potential biomarkers produced for psychiatric disorders. Then, 65 studies using GNNs that reported potential fMRI biomarkers for psychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia) published before 9 October 2024 were identified from 2 online databases (Scopus, PubMed). We found that while most studies have performant models, salient features highlighted in these studies (as determined by feature attribution scores) vary greatly across studies on the same disorder. Reproducibility of biomarkers is only limited to a small subset at the level of regions and few transdiagnostic biomarkers were identified. To address these issues, we suggest establishing new standards that are based on objective evaluation metrics to determine the robustness of these potential biomarkers. We further highlight gaps in the existing literature and put together a prediction-attribution-evaluation framework that could set the foundations for future research on discovering robust biomarkers of psychiatric disorders via GNNs.</p>
