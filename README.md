<h2>Journey of Lars Ahlfors' Fields Medal</h2>
<h3>Frank Wang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.12850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the story of the first Fields Medal awarded to Lars Ahlfors. It was smuggled out of Finland in 1944 during World War Two, and returned to Helsinki in 2004. It's based on an interview with Ahlfors' second daughter Vanessa Gruen, and existing publications.</p>

<h2>Base3: a simple interpolation-based ensemble method for robust dynamic link prediction</h2>
<h3>Kondrup Emma</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic link prediction remains a central challenge in temporal graph learning, particularly in designing models that are both effective and practical for real-world deployment. Existing approaches often rely on complex neural architectures, which are computationally intensive and difficult to interpret.
  In this work, we build on the strong recurrence-based foundation of the EdgeBank baseline, by supplementing it with inductive capabilities. We do so by leveraging the predictive power of non-learnable signals from two complementary perspectives: historical edge recurrence, as captured by EdgeBank, and global node popularity, as introduced in the PopTrack model. We propose t-CoMem, a lightweight memory module that tracks temporal co-occurrence patterns and neighborhood activity. Building on this, we introduce Base3, an interpolation-based model that fuses EdgeBank, PopTrack, and t-CoMem into a unified scoring framework. This combination effectively bridges local and global temporal dynamics -- repetition, popularity, and context -- without relying on training. Evaluated on the Temporal Graph Benchmark, Base3 achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art deep models, even outperforming them on some datasets. Importantly, it considerably improves on existing baselines' performance under more realistic and challenging negative sampling strategies -- offering a simple yet robust alternative for temporal graph learning.</p>

<h2>Seismic Acoustic Impedance Inversion Framework Based on Conditional Latent Generative Diffusion Model</h2>
<h3>Jie Chen, Hongling Chen, Jinghuai Gao, Chuangji Meng, Tao Yang, XinXin Liang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic acoustic impedance plays a crucial role in lithological identification and subsurface structure interpretation. However, due to the inherently ill-posed nature of the inversion problem, directly estimating impedance from post-stack seismic data remains highly challenging. Recently, diffusion models have shown great potential in addressing such inverse problems due to their strong prior learning and generative capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing methods operate in the pixel domain and require multiple iterations, limiting their applicability to field data. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel seismic acoustic impedance inversion framework based on a conditional latent generative diffusion model, where the inversion process is made in latent space. To avoid introducing additional training overhead when embedding conditional inputs, we design a lightweight wavelet-based module into the framework to project seismic data and reuse an encoder trained on impedance to embed low-frequency impedance into the latent space. Furthermore, we propose a model-driven sampling strategy during the inversion process of this framework to enhance accuracy and reduce the number of required diffusion steps. Numerical experiments on a synthetic model demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high inversion accuracy and strong generalization capability within only a few diffusion steps. Moreover, application to field data reveals enhanced geological detail and higher consistency with well-log measurements, validating the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach.</p>

<h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Bipedal Locomotion: A Brief Survey</h2>
<h3>Lingfan Bao, Joseph Humphreys, Tianhu Peng, Chengxu Zhou</h3>
<p>arXiv:2404.17070v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipedal robots are gaining global recognition due to their potential applications and advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). While DRL has significantly advanced bipedal locomotion, the development of a unified framework capable of handling a wide range of tasks remains an ongoing challenge. This survey systematically categorises, compares, and analyses existing DRL frameworks for bipedal locomotion, organising them into end-to-end and hierarchical control schemes. End-to-end frameworks are evaluated based on their learning approaches, while hierarchical frameworks are examined in terms of layered structures that integrate learning-based or traditional model-based methods. We provide a detailed evaluation of the composition, strengths, limitations, and capabilities of each framework. Additionally, this survey identifies key research gaps and proposes future directions aimed at creating a more integrated and efficient framework for bipedal locomotion, with wide-ranging applications in real-world environments.</p>

<h2>Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction via Rule-Regularized Heteroscedastic Deep Classification</h2>
<h3>Kumar Manas, Christian Schlauch, Adrian Paschke, Christian Wirth, Nadja Klein</h3>
<p>arXiv:2504.13111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page: https://kumarmanas.github.io/SHIFT/.</p>
