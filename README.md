<h2>Physics-based machine learning for fatigue lifetime prediction under non-uniform loading scenarios</h2>

<p>arXiv:2503.05419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate lifetime prediction of structures subjected to cyclic loading is vital, especially in scenarios involving non-uniform loading histories where load sequencing critically influences structural durability. Addressing this complexity requires advanced modeling approaches capable of capturing the intricate relationship between loading sequences and fatigue lifetime. Traditional fatigue simulations are computationally prohibitive, necessitating more efficient methods. This study highlights the potential of physics-based machine learning ($\phi$ML) to predict the fatigue lifetime of materials. Specifically, a FFNN is designed to embed physical constraints from experimental evidence directly into its architecture to enhance prediction accuracy. It is trained using numerical simulations generated by a physically based anisotropic continuum damage fatigue model. The model is calibrated and validated against experimental fatigue data of concrete cylinder specimens tested in uniaxial compression. The proposed approach demonstrates superior accuracy compared to purely data-driven neural networks, particularly in situations with limited training data, achieving realistic predictions of damage accumulation. Thus, a general algorithm is developed and successfully applied to predict fatigue lifetimes under complex loading scenarios with multiple loading ranges. Hereby, the $\phi$ML model serves as a surrogate to capture damage evolution across load transitions. The $\phi$ML based algorithm is subsequently employed to investigate the influence of multiple loading transitions on accumulated fatigue life, and its predictions align with trends observed in recent experimental studies. This work demonstrates $\phi$ML as a promising technique for efficient and reliable fatigue life prediction in engineering structures, with possible integration into digital twin models for real-time assessment.</p>

Abstract: When operating at their full capacity, quadrupedal robots can produce loud footstep noise, which can be disruptive in human-centered environments like homes, offices, and hospitals. As a result, balancing locomotion performance with noise constraints is crucial for the successful real-world deployment of quadrupedal robots. However, achieving adaptive noise control is challenging due to (a) the trade-off between agility and noise minimization, (b) the need for generalization across diverse deployment conditions, and (c) the difficulty of effectively adjusting policies based on noise requirements. We propose QuietPaw, a framework incorporating our Conditional Noise-Constrained Policy (CNCP), a constrained learning-based algorithm that enables flexible, noise-aware locomotion by conditioning policy behavior on noise-reduction levels. We leverage value representation decomposition in the critics, disentangling state representations from condition-dependent representations and this allows a single versatile policy to generalize across noise levels without retraining while improving the Pareto trade-off between agility and noise reduction. We validate our approach in simulation and the real world, demonstrating that CNCP can effectively balance locomotion performance and noise constraints, achieving continuously adjustable noise reduction.</p>

Abstract: Instructors play a pivotal role in integrating AI into education, yet their adoption of AI-powered tools remains inconsistent. Despite this, limited research explores how to design AI tools that support broader instructor adoption. This study applies a human-centered design approach, incorporating qualitative methods, to investigate the design of interactive pedagogical agents that provide instructional suggestions in response to instructors' questions. We conducted a formative study involving interviews with five pedagogy experts to examine existing strategies for supporting instructors' pedagogical needs. Building on these insights, we facilitated a participatory design session with ten pedagogy experts, where participants reviewed a storyboard depicting a chatbot designed for instructors with varying levels of AI literacy and differing attitudes toward AI. Experts also evaluated the quality of LLM-generated suggestions based on common teaching challenges. Our findings highlight the need for chatbot interactions that foster trust, especially for AI-conservative instructors. Experts emphasized the importance of social transparency (for example, showing how peers use the tool) and allowing instructors to flexibly control how much or how little they engage with the system. We also propose design recommendations to enhance the quality of AI-generated teaching suggestions, such as adapting them to reflect instructors' prior teaching experience. This work underscores the urgent need to support AI-conservative instructors, as AI literacy and attitudes are closely intertwined. Without thoughtful design, there is a risk of widening pedagogical divides and reducing students' learning opportunities.</p>
