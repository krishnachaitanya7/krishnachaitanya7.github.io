<h2>REDACTOR: eFPGA Redaction for DNN Accelerator Security</h2>
<h3>Yazan Baddour, Ava Hedayatipour, Amin Rezaei</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.18740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ever-increasing integration of artificial intelligence into daily life and the growing importance of well-trained models, the security of hardware accelerators supporting Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has become paramount. As a promising solution to prevent hardware intellectual property theft, eFPGA redaction has emerged. This technique selectively conceals critical components of the design, allowing authorized users to restore functionality post-fabrication by inserting the correct bitstream. In this paper, we explore the redaction of DNN accelerators using eFPGAs, from specification to physical design implementation. Specifically, we investigate the selection of critical DNN modules for redaction using both regular and fracturable look-up tables. We perform synthesis, timing verification, and place & route on redacted DNN accelerators. Furthermore, we evaluate the overhead of incorporating eFPGAs into DNN accelerators in terms of power, area, and delay, finding it reasonable given the security benefits.</p>

<h2>Perceptive Mixed-Integer Footstep Control for Underactuated Bipedal Walking on Rough Terrain</h2>
<h3>Brian Acosta, Michael Posa</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.19391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traversing rough terrain requires dynamic bipeds to stabilize themselves through foot placement without stepping in unsafe areas. Planning these footsteps online is challenging given non-convexity of the safe terrain, and imperfect perception and state estimation. This paper addresses these challenges with a full-stack perception and control system for achieving underactuated walking on discontinuous terrain. First, we develop model-predictive footstep control (MPFC), a single mixed-integer quadratic program which assumes a convex polygon terrain decomposition to optimize over discrete foothold choice, footstep position, ankle torque, template dynamics, and footstep timing at over 100 Hz. We then propose a novel approach for generating convex polygon terrain decompositions online. Our perception stack decouples safe-terrain classification from fitting planar polygons, generating a temporally consistent terrain segmentation in real time using a single CPU thread. We demonstrate the performance of our perception and control stack through outdoor experiments with the underactuated biped Cassie, achieving state of the art perceptive bipedal walking on discontinuous terrain.

<h2>MaxCutPool: differentiable feature-aware Maxcut for pooling in graph neural networks</h2>
<h3>Carlo Abate, Filippo Maria Bianchi</h3>
<p>arXiv:2409.05100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to compute the MAXCUT in attributed graphs, i.e., graphs with features associated with nodes and edges. Our approach works well on any kind of graph topology and can find solutions that jointly optimize the MAXCUT along with other objectives. Based on the obtained MAXCUT partition, we implement a hierarchical graph pooling layer for Graph Neural Networks, which is sparse, trainable end-to-end, and particularly suitable for downstream tasks on heterophilic graphs.</p>

<h2>Clustering of functional data prone to complex heteroscedastic measurement error</h2>
<h3>Andi Mai, Lan Xue, Roger Zoh, Carmen Tekwe</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.14919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several factors make clustering of functional data challenging, including the infinite-dimensional space to which observations belong and the lack of a defined probability density function for the functional random variable. To overcome these barriers, researchers either assume that observations belong to a finite-dimensional space spanned by basis functions or apply nonparametric smoothing methods to the functions prior to clustering. Although extensive literature describes clustering methods for functional data, few studies have explored the clustering of measurement error--prone function-valued data. In this work, we consider clustering methods for functional data prone to complex, heteroscedastic measurement errors. Two stage-based methods using mixed-effects models are first applied to adjust for measurement error bias, followed by cluster analysis of the measurement error--adjusted curves. Through simulations, we investigate how varying sample size, the magnitude of measurement error, and the presence of complex heteroscedastic measurement errors influence the cluster analysis of functional data. Our results indicate that failing to account for measurement errors and the correlation structures associated with frequently collected functional data reduces the accuracy of identifying the true latent groups or clusters. The method consistently produces better results regardless of the initial clustering values used. Moreover, it is flexible and can be applied to various clustering approaches, based on the specific distribution of the data. The developed methods are applied to two data sets: a school-based study of energy expenditure among elementary school-aged children in Texas and data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey on participants' physical activity monitored by wearable devices at frequent intervals.</p>
