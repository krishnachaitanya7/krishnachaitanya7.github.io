<h2>Cancer Detection via Electrical Impedance Tomography and Optimal Control of Elliptic PDEs</h2>
<h3>Ugur G. Abdulla, Jose H. Rodrigues</h3>
<p>arXiv:2509.02050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pursue a computational analysis of the biomedical problem on the identification of the cancerous tumor at an early stage of development based on the Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) and optimal control of elliptic partial differential equations. Relying on the fact that the electrical conductivity of the cancerous tumor is significantly higher than the conductivity of the healthy tissue, we consider an inverse EIT problem on the identification of the conductivity map in the complete electrode model based on the $m$ current-to-voltage measurements on the boundary electrodes. A variational formulation as a PDE-constrained optimal control problem is introduced based on the novel idea of increasing the size of the input data by adding "voltage-to-current" measurements through various permutations of the single "current-to-voltage" measurement. The idea of permutation preserves the size of the unknown parameters on the expense of increase of the number of PDE constraints. We apply a gradient projection (GPM) method based on the Fr\'echet differentiability in Besov-Hilbert spaces. Numerical simulations of 2D and 3D model examples demonstrate the sharp increase of the resolution of the cancerous tumor by increasing the number of measurements from $m$ to $m^2$</p>

<h2>Embedability of right-angled Artin groups into hierarchically hyperbolic groups</h2>
<h3>Sangrok Oh, Jihoon Park</h3>
<p>arXiv:2509.02454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a hierarchically hyperbolic group, we provide sufficient conditions under which suitable powers of a finite collection of elements generate a right-angled Artin subgroup. Under additional hypotheses, we further show that this subgroup can be promoted to be quasi-isometrically embedded. Our framework recovers and unifies earlier results, including those of Clay-Leininger-Mangahas \cite{CLM12} and Runnels \cite{Run21} for mapping class groups, and of Kim-Koberda \cite{KK13} for right-angled Artin groups.</p>

<h2>The Effect of Predation on the Dynamics of Chronic Wasting Disease in Deer</h2>
<h3>Cody E. FitzGerald, James P. Keener</h3>
<p>arXiv:2509.00134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a neurological disease impacting deer, elk, moose, and other cervid populations and is caused by a misfolded protein known as a prion. CWD is difficult to control due to the persistence of prions in the environment. Prions can remain infectious for more than a decade and have been found in soil as well as other environmental vectors, such as ticks and plants. Here, we provide a bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of CWD spread in a cervid population, and use a modification of the Gillespie algorithm to explore if wolves can be used as an ecological control strategy to limit the spread of the disease in several relevant scenarios. We then analytically compute the probability that the disease spreads given one infected member enters a fully healthy population and the probability of elimination, given a fully susceptible population and remaining prions in the environment. From our analysis, we conclude that wolves can be used as an effective control strategy to limit the spread of CWD in cervid populations, and hunting or other means of lowering the susceptible population are beneficial to controlling the spread of CWD, although it is important to note that inferring biologically relevant parameters from the existing data is an ongoing challenge for this system.</p>

<h2>Resampling-based multi-resolution false discovery exceedance control</h2>
<h3>Jesse Hemerik</h3>
<p>arXiv:2509.02376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MaxT is a highly popular resampling-based multiple testing procedure, which controls the familywise error rate (FWER) and is powerful under dependence. This paper generalizes maxT to what we term ``multi-resolution'' False Discovery eXceedance (FDX) control. FDX control means ensuring that the FDP -- the proportion of false discoveries among all rejections -- is at most $\gamma$ with probability at least $1-\alpha$. Here $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ are prespecified, small values between 0 and 1. If we take $\gamma=0$, FDX control is the same as FWER control. When $\gamma=0$, the new procedure reduces to maxT. For $\gamma>0$, our method has much higher power. Our method is then strongly connected to maxT as well. For example, if our method rejects fewer than $\gamma^{-1}$ hypotheses, then maxT rejects the same. Further, the implied global tests of the two methods are the same, although the implied closed testing procedures differ. Finally, our method provides an easy-to-use simultaneous, multi-resolution guarantee: the procedure outputs a single rejection threshold $q$, but ensures that with probability $1-\alpha$, simultaneously over all stricter thresholds, the corresponding FDPs are also below $\gamma$.</p>

<h2>Decomposing heterogeneous dynamical systems with graph neural networks</h2>
<h3>C\'edric Allier, Magdalena C. Schneider, Michael Innerberger, Larissa Heinrich, John A. Bogovic, Stephan Saalfeld</h3>
<p>arXiv:2407.19160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural physical, chemical, and biological dynamical systems are often complex, with heterogeneous components interacting in diverse ways. We show how simple graph neural networks can be designed to jointly learn the interaction rules and the latent heterogeneity from observable dynamics. The learned latent heterogeneity and dynamics can be used to virtually decompose the complex system which is necessary to infer and parameterize the underlying governing equations. We tested the approach with simulation experiments of interacting moving particles, vector fields, and signaling networks. While our current aim is to better understand and validate the approach with simulated data, we anticipate it to become a generally applicable tool to uncover the governing rules underlying complex dynamics observed in nature.</p>

<h2>The Gold Medals in an Empty Room: Diagnosing Metalinguistic Reasoning in LLMs with Camlang</h2>
<h3>Fenghua Liu, Yulong Chen, Yixuan Liu, Zhujun Jin, Solomon Tsai, Ming Zhong</h3>
<p>arXiv:2509.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup, and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang, creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human metalinguistic competence.</p>

<h3>Jiahao Qiu, Jingzhe Shi, Xinzhe Juan, Zelin Zhao, Jiayi Geng, Shilong Liu, Hongru Wang, Sanfeng Wu, Mengdi Wang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2509.01659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics provides fundamental laws that describe and predict the natural world. AI systems aspiring toward more general, real-world intelligence must therefore demonstrate strong physics problem-solving abilities: to formulate and apply physical laws for explaining and predicting physical processes. The International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)--the world's most prestigious physics competition--offers a rigorous benchmark for this purpose. We introduce Physics Supernova, an AI agent system with superior physics problem-solving abilities that match elite IPhO gold medalists. In IPhO 2025 theory problems, Physics Supernova attains 23.5/30 points, ranking 14th of 406 contestants and surpassing the median performance of human gold medalists. We extensively analyzed Physics Supernova's capabilities and flexibility across diverse physics tasks. These results show that principled tool integration within agent systems can deliver competitive improvements in solving challenging science problems.

<h2>Multi-Touch and Bending Perception Using Electrical Impedance Tomography for Robotics</h2>
<h3>Haofeng Chen, Bedrich Himmel, Bin Li, Xiaojie Wang, Matej Hoffmann</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.13048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) offers a promising solution for distributed tactile sensing with minimal wiring and full-surface coverage in robotic applications. However, EIT-based tactile sensors face significant challenges during surface bending. Deformation alters the baseline impedance distribution and couples with touch-induced conductivity variations, complicating signal interpretation. To address this challenge, we present a novel sensing framework that integrates a deep neural network for interaction state classification with a dynamic adaptive reference strategy to decouple touch and deformation signals, while a data-driven regression model translates EIT voltage changes into continuous bending angles. The framework is validated using a magnetic hydrogel composite sensor that conforms to bendable surfaces. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves precise and robust bending angle estimation, high accuracy in distinguishing touch, bending, and idle states, and significantly improves touch localization quality under bending deformation compared to conventional fixed-reference methods. Real-time experiments confirm the system's capability to reliably detect multi-touch interactions and track bending angles across varying deformation conditions. This work paves the way for flexible EIT-based robotic skins capable of rich multimodal sensing in robotics and human-robot interaction.</p>

<h2>Toward Real-World Cooperative and Competitive Soccer with Quadrupedal Robot Teams</h2>
<h3>Zhi Su, Yuman Gao, Emily Lukas, Yunfei Li, Jiaze Cai, Faris Tulbah, Fei Gao, Chao Yu, Zhongyu Li, Yi Wu, Koushil Sreenath</h3>
<p>arXiv:2505.13834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving coordinated teamwork among legged robots requires both fine-grained locomotion control and long-horizon strategic decision-making. Robot soccer offers a compelling testbed for this challenge, combining dynamic, competitive, and multi-agent interactions. In this work, we present a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables fully autonomous and decentralized quadruped robot soccer. First, a set of highly dynamic low-level skills is trained for legged locomotion and ball manipulation, such as walking, dribbling, and kicking. On top of these, a high-level strategic planning policy is trained with Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) via Fictitious Self-Play (FSP). This learning framework allows agents to adapt to diverse opponent strategies and gives rise to sophisticated team behaviors, including coordinated passing, interception, and dynamic role allocation. With an extensive ablation study, the proposed learning method shows significant advantages in the cooperative and competitive multi-agent soccer game. We deploy the learned policies to real quadruped robots relying solely on onboard proprioception and decentralized localization, with the resulting system supporting autonomous robot-robot and robot-human soccer matches on indoor and outdoor soccer courts.</p>

<h2>LocoTouch: Learning Dynamic Quadrupedal Transport with Tactile Sensing</h2>
<h3>Changyi Lin, Yuxin Ray Song, Boda Huo, Mingyang Yu, Yikai Wang, Shiqi Liu, Yuxiang Yang, Wenhao Yu, Tingnan Zhang, Jie Tan, Yiyue Luo, Ding Zhao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2505.23175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated remarkable agility and robustness in traversing complex terrains. However, they struggle with dynamic object interactions, where contact must be precisely sensed and controlled. To bridge this gap, we present LocoTouch, a system that equips quadrupedal robots with tactile sensing to address a particularly challenging task in this category: long-distance transport of unsecured cylindrical objects, which typically requires custom mounting or fastening mechanisms to maintain stability. For efficient large-area tactile sensing, we design a high-density distributed tactile sensor that covers the entire back of the robot. To effectively leverage tactile feedback for robot control, we develop a simulation environment with high-fidelity tactile signals, and train tactile-aware transport policies using a two-stage learning pipeline. Furthermore, we design a novel reward function to promote robust, symmetric, and frequency-adaptive locomotion gaits. After training in simulation, LocoTouch transfers zero-shot to the real world, reliably transporting a wide range of unsecured cylindrical objects with diverse sizes, weights, and surface properties. Moreover, it remains robust over long distances, on uneven terrain, and under severe perturbations.</p>
