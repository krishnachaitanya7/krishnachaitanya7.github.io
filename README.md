<p>arXiv:2505.17164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a pedagogical introduction to the concepts underlying black hole information loss, intended for readers familiar with special relativity and quantum mechanics. We emphasize that there is no paradox of information loss, and that proposals suggesting deviations from well-established theories at arbitrary regimes are inherently contradictory.</p>

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, producing help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted microinterventions. The adaptive learning algorithm includes three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted limit for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formulate intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows derived from ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy with diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency settings, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid switches along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with 1204 students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for nearly all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by about 12 percentage points relative to greedy and produced more consistent difficulty alignment, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy at lower computational cost in resource-scarce environments. Slack variables localized missing content and guided targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across student subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic pedagogical loop and enables equitable, load-aware personalization at the classroom scale.</p>

Abstract: Background: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has emerged as a promising tool for detecting physiological changes linked to non-cardiac disorders. Given the close connection between cardiovascular and neurocognitive health, ECG abnormalities may be present in individuals with co-occurring neurocognitive conditions. This highlights the potential of ECG as a biomarker to improve detection, therapy monitoring, and risk stratification in patients with neurocognitive disorders, an area that remains underexplored.
  Methods: We aim to demonstrate the feasibility to predict neurocognitive disorders from ECG features across diverse patient populations. We utilized ECG features and demographic data to predict neurocognitive disorders defined by ICD-10 codes, focusing on dementia, delirium, and Parkinson's disease. Internal and external validations were performed using the MIMIC-IV and ECG-View datasets. Predictive performance was assessed using AUROC scores, and Shapley values were used to interpret feature contributions.
  Results: Significant predictive performance was observed for disorders within the neurcognitive disorders. Significantly, the disorders with the highest predictive performance is F03: Dementia, with an internal AUROC of 0.848 (95% CI: 0.848-0.848) and an external AUROC of 0.865 (0.864-0.965), followed by G30: Alzheimer's, with an internal AUROC of 0.809 (95% CI: 0.808-0.810) and an external AUROC of 0.863 (95% CI: 0.863-0.864). Feature importance analysis revealed both known and novel ECG correlates. ECGs hold promise as non-invasive, explainable biomarkers for selected neurocognitive disorders. This study demonstrates robust performance across cohorts and lays the groundwork for future clinical applications, including early detection and personalized monitoring.</p>
