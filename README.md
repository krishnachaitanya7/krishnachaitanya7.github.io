Abstract: Graph neural networks, recently introduced into the field of fluid flow surrogate modeling, have been successfully applied to model the temporal evolution of various fluid flow systems. Existing applications, however, are mostly restricted to cases where the domain is time-invariant. The present work extends the application of graph neural network-based modeling to fluid flow around structures rotating with respect to a certain axis. Specifically, we propose to apply a graph neural network-based surrogate modeling for fluid flow with the mesh corotating with the structure. Unlike conventional data-driven approaches that rely on structured Cartesian meshes, our framework operates on unstructured co-rotating meshes, enforcing rotation equivariance of the learned model by leveraging co-rotating polar (2D) and cylindrical (3D) coordinate systems. To model the pressure for systems without Dirichlet pressure boundaries, we propose a novel local directed pressure difference formulation that is invariant to the reference pressure point and value. For flow systems with large mesh sizes, we introduce a scheme to train the network in single or distributed graphics processing units by accumulating the backpropagated gradients from partitions of the mesh. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is examined on two test cases: (i) fluid flow in a 2D rotating mixer, and (ii) the flow past a 3D rotating cube. Our results show that the model achieves stable and accurate rollouts for over 2000 time steps in periodic regimes while capturing accurate short-term dynamics in chaotic flow regimes. In addition, the drag and lift force predictions closely match the CFD calculations, highlighting the potential of the framework for modeling both periodic and chaotic fluid flow around rotating structures.</p>

Abstract: Dynamic loco-manipulation calls for effective whole-body control and contact-rich interactions with the object and the environment. Existing learning-based control synthesis relies on training low-level skill policies and explicitly switching with a high-level policy or a hand-designed finite state machine, leading to quasi-static behaviors. In contrast, dynamic tasks such as soccer require the robot to run towards the ball, decelerate to an optimal approach to dribble, and eventually kick a goal - a continuum of smooth motion. To this end, we propose Preferenced Oracle Guided Multi-mode Policies (OGMP) to learn a single policy mastering all the required modes and preferred sequence of transitions to solve uni-object loco-manipulation tasks. We design hybrid automatons as oracles to generate references with continuous dynamics and discrete mode jumps to perform a guided policy optimization through bounded exploration. To enforce learning a desired sequence of mode transitions, we present a task-agnostic preference reward that enhances performance. The proposed approach demonstrates successful loco-manipulation for tasks like soccer and moving boxes omnidirectionally through whole-body control. In soccer, a single policy learns to optimally reach the ball, transition to contact-rich dribbling, and execute successful goal kicks and ball stops. Leveraging the oracle's abstraction, we solve each loco-manipulation task on robots with varying morphologies, including HECTOR V1, Berkeley Humanoid, Unitree G1, and H1, using the same reward definition and weights.</p>
