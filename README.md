Abstract: We establish a negative moment bound for the sample autocovariance matrix of a stationary process driven by conditional heteroscedastic errors. This moment bound enables us to asymptotically express the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) of the least squares predictor as the sum of three terms related to model complexity, model misspecification, and conditional heteroscedasticity. A direct application of this expression is the development of a model selection criterion that can asymptotically identify the best (in the sense of MSPE) subset AR model in the presence of misspecification and conditional heteroscedasticity. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to confirm our theoretical results.</p>

Abstract: Humans are experts in collaborating with others physically by regulating compliance behaviors based on the perception of their partner states and the task requirements. Enabling robots to develop proficiency in human collaboration skills can facilitate more efficient human-robot collaboration (HRC). This paper introduces an innovative impedance regulation skill learning framework for achieving HRC in multiple physical collaborative tasks. The framework is designed to adjust the robot compliance to the human partner states while adhering to reference trajectories provided by human-human demonstrations. Specifically, electromyography (EMG) signals from human muscles are collected and analyzed to extract limb impedance, representing compliance behaviors during demonstrations. Human endpoint motions are captured and represented using a probabilistic learning method to create reference trajectories and corresponding impedance profiles. Meanwhile, an LSTMbased module is implemented to develop task-oriented impedance regulation policies by mapping the muscle synergistic contributions between two demonstrators. Finally, we propose a wholebody impedance controller for a human-like robot, coordinating joint outputs to achieve the desired impedance and reference trajectory during task execution. Experimental validation was conducted through a collaborative transportation task and two interactive Tai Chi pushing hands tasks, demonstrating superior performance from the perspective of interactive forces compared to a constant impedance control method.</p>
