<h2>A descent-excedance correspondence in colored permutation groups</h2>

<p>arXiv:2410.23206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that descents and excedances are equidistributed in the symmetric group. We show that the descent and excedance enumerators, summed over permutations with a fixed first letter are identical when we perform a simple change of the first letter. We generalize this to type B and other colored permutation groups. We are led to defining descents and excedances through linear orders. With respect to a particular order, when the number of colors is even, we get a result that generalizes the type B results. Lastly, we get a type B counterpart of Conger's result which refines the well known Carlitz identity.</p>

<h2>LLMs Integration in Software Engineering Team Projects: Roles, Impact, and a Pedagogical Design Space for AI Tools in Computing Education</h2>

<p>arXiv:2410.23069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work takes a pedagogical lens to explore the implications of generative AI (GenAI) models and tools, such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, in a semester-long 2nd-year undergraduate Software Engineering Team Project. Qualitative findings from survey (39 students) and interviews (eight students) provide insights into the students' views on the impact of GenAI use on their coding experience, learning, and self-efficacy. Our results address a particular gap in understanding the role and implications of GenAI on teamwork, team-efficacy, and team dynamics. The analysis of the learning aspects is distinguished by the application of learning and pedagogy informed lenses to discuss the data. We propose a preliminary design space for GenAI-based programming learning tools highlighting the importance of considering the roles that GenAI can play during the learning process, the varying support-ability patterns that can be applied to each role, and the importance of supporting transparency in GenAI for team members and students in addition to educators.</p>

<h2>The SPORT-C Intervention: An Integration of Sports, Case-Based Pedagogy and Systems Thinking Learning</h2>
<h3>Jeffrey Basoah, William Scherer, Karis Boyd-Sinkler, Reid Bailey</h3>
<p>arXiv:2307.11755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The STEM field is unrepresentative of the population it serves. Due to a lack of cultural relevance in STEM courses, there is a dissociation between the lived experience of students from underrepresented racial groups (URG) and STEM course material. The SPORT-C intervention is a framework that combines sports, systems thinking learning, and a case-based pedagogy into an activity that can be used in any STEM course. A pilot study was conducted to determine the viability of the SPORT-C intervention in a classroom setting and determine if it was worth further investigating and if any impact differed by racial identity. The findings from this study implicate that the SPORT-C intervention has an impact on the motivation levels of students to participate in STEM courses.</p>
