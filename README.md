<h2>Tutorial Problems for Nonsmooth Dynamics and Optimal Control: Ski Jumping and Accelerating a Bike Without Pedaling</h2>
<h3>Julian Golembiewski, Timm Faulwasser</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.15810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonsmooth phenomena, such as abrupt changes, impacts, and switching behaviors, frequently arise in real-world systems and present significant challenges for traditional optimal control methods, which typically assume smoothness and differentiability. These phenomena introduce numerical challenges in both simulation and optimization, highlighting the need for specialized solution methods. Although various applications and test problems have been documented in the literature, many are either overly simplified, excessively complex, or narrowly focused on specific domains. On this canvas, this paper proposes two novel tutorial problems that are both conceptually accessible and allow for further scaling of problem difficulty. The first problem features a simple ski jump model, characterized by state-dependent jumps and sliding motion on impact surfaces. This system does not involve control inputs and serves as a testbed for simulating nonsmooth dynamics. The second problem considers optimal control of a special type of bicycle model. This problem is inspired by practical techniques observed in BMX riding and mountain biking, where riders accelerate their bike without pedaling by strategically shifting their center of mass in response to the track's slope.</p>

<h2>Hypergraph clustering using Ricci curvature: an edge transport perspective</h2>

<p>arXiv:2412.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method for extending Ricci flow to hypergraphs by defining probability measures on the edges and transporting them on the line expansion. This approach yields a new weighting on the edges, which proves particularly effective for community detection. We extensively compare this method with a similar notion of Ricci flow defined on the clique expansion, demonstrating its enhanced sensitivity to the hypergraph structure, especially in the presence of large hyperedges. The two methods are complementary and together form a powerful and highly interpretable framework for community detection in hypergraphs.</p>
