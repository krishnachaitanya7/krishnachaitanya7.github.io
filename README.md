<h2>Interpreting type theory in a quasicategory: a Yoneda approach</h2>
<h3>El Mehdi Cherradi</h3>
<p>arXiv:2207.01967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make use of a higher version of the Yoneda embedding to construct, from a given quasicategory, a tribe, as a subcategory of a well-behaved simplicial model category, that presents the same $(\infty,1)$-category as the former quasicategory. We then show that, when the quasicategory is locally cartesian closed, it is possible to further endow such a tribe with enough structure for it to provide a model of Martin-L\"of type theory with $\Pi$-types. This mapping procedure restricts so that elementary higher topoi yield models of homotopy type theory.</p>

<h2>Acrobotics: A Generalist Approahc To Quadrupedal Robots' Parkour</h2>

Abstract: Climbing, crouching, bridging gaps, and walking up stairs are just a few of the advantages that quadruped robots have over wheeled robots, making them more suitable for navigating rough and unstructured terrain. However, executing such manoeuvres requires precise temporal coordination and complex agent-environment interactions. Moreover, legged locomotion is inherently more prone to slippage and tripping, and the classical approach of modeling such cases to design a robust controller thus quickly becomes impractical. In contrast, reinforcement learning offers a compelling solution by enabling optimal control through trial and error. We present a generalist reinforcement learning algorithm for quadrupedal agents in dynamic motion scenarios. The learned policy rivals state-of-the-art specialist policies trained using a mixture of experts approach, while using only 25% as many agents during training. Our experiments also highlight the key components of the generalist locomotion policy and the primary factors contributing to its success.</p>

<h2>CTBC: Contact-Triggered Blind Climbing for Wheeled Bipedal Robots with Instruction Learning and Reinforcement Learning</h2>

<p>arXiv:2509.02986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, wheeled bipedal robots have gained increasing attention due to their advantages in mobility, such as high-speed locomotion on flat terrain. However, their performance on complex environments (e.g., staircases) remains inferior to that of traditional legged robots. To overcome this limitation, we propose a general contact-triggered blind climbing (CTBC) framework for wheeled bipedal robots. Upon detecting wheel-obstacle contact, the robot triggers a leg-lifting motion to overcome the obstacle. By leveraging a strongly-guided feedforward trajectory, our method enables the robot to rapidly acquire agile leg-lifting skills, significantly enhancing its capability to traverse unstructured terrains. The approach has been experimentally validated and successfully deployed on LimX Dynamics' wheeled bipedal robot, Tron1. Real-world tests demonstrate that Tron1 can reliably climb obstacles well beyond its wheel radius using only proprioceptive feedback.</p>

<p>arXiv:2509.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art data-driven tool for modeling connectivity data of graph-structured complex networks and integrating information of their nodes and edges in space and time. However, as of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.</p>
