<p>arXiv:2511.06397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wheeled bipedal robots have garnered increasing attention in exploration and inspection. However, most research simplifies calculations by ignoring leg dynamics, thereby restricting the robot's full motion potential. Additionally, robots face challenges when traversing uneven terrain. To address the aforementioned issue, we develop a complete dynamics model and design a whole-body control framework with terrain estimation for a novel 6 degrees of freedom wheeled bipedal robot. This model incorporates the closed-loop dynamics of the robot and a ground contact model based on the estimated ground normal vector. We use a LiDAR inertial odometry framework and improved Principal Component Analysis for terrain estimation. Task controllers, including PD control law and LQR, are employed for pose control and centroidal dynamics-based balance control, respectively. Furthermore, a hierarchical optimization approach is used to solve the whole-body control problem. We validate the performance of the terrain estimation algorithm and demonstrate the algorithm's robustness and ability to traverse uneven terrain through both simulation and real-world experiments.</p>

<h2>Sim-to-Real Transfer in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Bipedal Locomotion</h2>
<h3>Lingfan Bao, Tianhu Peng, Chengxu Zhou</h3>
<p>arXiv:2511.06465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter addresses the critical challenge of simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in bipedal locomotion. After contextualizing the problem within various control architectures, we dissect the ``curse of simulation'' by analyzing the primary sources of sim-to-real gap: robot dynamics, contact modeling, state estimation, and numerical solvers. Building on this diagnosis, we structure the solutions around two complementary philosophies. The first is to shrink the gap through model-centric strategies that systematically improve the simulator's physical fidelity. The second is to harden the policy, a complementary approach that uses in-simulation robustness training and post-deployment adaptation to make the policy inherently resilient to model inaccuracies. The chapter concludes by synthesizing these philosophies into a strategic framework, providing a clear roadmap for developing and evaluating robust sim-to-real solutions.</p>

<h2>How AI Fails: An Interactive Pedagogical Tool for Demonstrating Dialectal Bias in Automated Toxicity Models</h2>
<h3>Subhojit Ghimire</h3>
<p>arXiv:2511.06676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Now that AI-driven moderation has become pervasive in everyday life, we often hear claims that "the AI is biased". While this is often said jokingly, the light-hearted remark reflects a deeper concern. How can we be certain that an online post flagged as "inappropriate" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for "identity hate". Second, I introduce an interactive pedagogical tool that makes these abstract biases tangible. The tool's core mechanic, a user-controlled "sensitivity threshold," demonstrates that the biased score itself is not the only harm; instead, the more-concerning harm is the human-set, seemingly neutral policy that ultimately operationalises discrimination. This work provides both statistical evidence of disparate impact and a public-facing tool designed to foster critical AI literacy.</p>

<h2>Pedagogical Reflections on the Holistic Cognitive Development (HCD) Framework and AI-Augmented Learning in Creative Computing</h2>
<h3>BHojan Anand</h3>
<p>arXiv:2511.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an expanded account of the Holistic Cognitive Development (HCD) framework for reflective and creative learning in computing education. The HCD framework integrates design thinking, experiential learning, and reflective practice into a unified constructivist pedagogy emphasizing autonomy, ownership, and scaffolding. It is applied across courses in game design (CS3247, CS4350), virtual reality (CS4240), and extended reality systems, where students engage in iterative cycles of thinking, creating, criticizing, and reflecting. The paper also examines how AI-augmented systems such as iReflect, ReflexAI, and Knowledge Graph-enhanced LLM feedback tools operationalize the HCD framework through scalable, personalized feedback. Empirical findings demonstrate improved reflective depth, feedback quality, and learner autonomy. The work advocates a balance of supportive autonomy in supervision, where students practice self-directed inquiry while guided through structured reflection and feedback.</p>

<h2>EduGuardBench: A Holistic Benchmark for Evaluating the Pedagogical Fidelity and Adversarial Safety of LLMs as Simulated Teachers</h2>
<h3>Yilin Jiang, Mingzi Zhang, Xuanyu Yin, Sheng Jin, Suyu Lu, Zuocan Ying, Zengyi Yu, Xiangjie Kong</h3>
<p>arXiv:2511.06890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models for Simulating Professions (SP-LLMs), particularly as teachers, are pivotal for personalized education. However, ensuring their professional competence and ethical safety is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks fail to measure role-playing fidelity or address the unique teaching harms inherent in educational scenarios. To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals. This capacity is strongly negatively correlated with ASR, revealing a new dimension of advanced AI safety. EduGuardBench thus provides a reproducible framework that moves beyond siloed knowledge tests toward a holistic assessment of professional, ethical, and pedagogical alignment, uncovering complex dynamics essential for deploying trustworthy AI in education.

<h2>Probabilistic Wind Power Modelling via Heteroscedastic Non-Stationary Gaussian Processes</h2>
<h3>Domniki Ladopoulou, Dat Minh Hong, Petros Dellaportas</h3>
<p>arXiv:2505.09026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate probabilistic prediction of wind power is crucial for maintaining grid stability and facilitating the efficient integration of renewable energy sources. Gaussian process (GP) models offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty; however, conventional approaches typically rely on stationary kernels and homoscedastic noise assumptions, which are inadequate for modelling the inherently non-stationary and heteroscedastic nature of wind speed and power output. We propose a heteroscedastic non-stationary GP framework based on the generalised spectral mixture kernel, enabling the model to capture input-dependent correlations as well as input-dependent variability in wind speed-power data. We evaluate the proposed model on 10-minute supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements and compare it against GP variants with stationary and non-stationary kernels, as well as commonly used non-GP probabilistic baselines. The results highlight the necessity of modelling both non-stationarity and heteroscedasticity in wind power prediction and demonstrate the practical value of flexible non-stationary GP models in operational SCADA settings.</p>
