<h2>Ekedahl-Oort Types and Newton Polygons of Abelian Covers of $\mathbf{P}^1$ Branched at Three Points</h2>
<h3>Darren Schmidt</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.07693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Newton polygons and Ekedahl-Oort types of reductions of abelian covers of the projective line branched at three points modulo a prime. We study the natural density of primes where these covers give supersingular and superspecial curves and show they appear much more often than expected. We also show that unlikely Newton polygons and Ekedahl-Oort types in the moduli space of curves appear frequently. Finally, we prove a theorem that provides evidence of Oort's Conjecture about Newton polygons in certain cases and gives new constructions of supersingular curves.</p>

<h2>Data Completion for Electrical Impedance Tomography by Conditional Diffusion Models</h2>
<h3>Ke Chen, Haizhao Yang, Chugang Yi</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.07813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data scarcity is a fundamental barrier in Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), as undersampled Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) measurements can substantially degrade conductivity reconstructions. We address this bottleneck by completing partially observed DtN measurements using a diffusion based generative model. Specifically, we train a conditional diffusion model to learn the distribution of DtN data and to infer full measurement vectors given partial observations. Our approach supports flexible source receiver configurations and can be used as a plug in preprocessing step with off the shelf EIT solvers. Under mild assumptions on the polygon conductivity class, we derive nonasymptotic end to end bounds on the distributional discrepancy between the completed and ground truth DtN measurements. In numerical experiments, we couple the proposed diffusion completion procedure with a deep learning based inverse solver and compare its performance against the same solver with full measurement data. The results show that diffusion completion enables reconstructions comparable to the full data baseline while using only 1% of the measurements. In contrast, standard baselines such as matrix completion require 30% of the measurements to achieve similar reconstruction quality.</p>

<h2>Graph homophily booster: Reimagining the role of discrete features in heterophilic graph learning</h2>
<h3>Ruizhong Qiu, Ting-Wei Li, Gaotang Li, Hanghang Tong</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.</p>

<h2>UEREBot: Learning Safe Quadrupedal Locomotion under Unstructured Environments and High-Speed Dynamic Obstacles</h2>
<h3>Zihao Xu, Runyu Lei, Zihao Li, Boxi Lin, Ce Hao, Jin Song Dong</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadruped robots are increasingly deployed in unstructured environments. Safe locomotion in these settings requires long-horizon goal progress, passability over uneven terrain and static constraints, and collision avoidance against high-speed dynamic obstacles. A single system cannot fully satisfy all three objectives simultaneously: planning-based decisions can be too slow, while purely reactive decisions can sacrifice goal progress and passability. To resolve this conflict, we propose UEREBot (Unstructured-Environment Reflexive Evasion Robot), a hierarchical framework that separates slow planning from instantaneous reflexive evasion and coordinates them during execution. UEREBot formulates the task as a constrained optimal control problem blueprint. It adopts a spatial--temporal planner that provides reference guidance toward the goal and threat signals. It then uses a threat-aware handoff to fuse navigation and reflex actions into a nominal command, and a control barrier function shield as a final execution safeguard. We evaluate UEREBot in Isaac Lab simulation and deploy it on a Unitree Go2 quadruped equipped with onboard perception. Across diverse environments with complex static structure and high-speed dynamic obstacles, UEREBot achieves higher avoidance success and more stable locomotion while maintaining goal progress than representative baselines, demonstrating improved safety--progress trade-offs.</p>

<h2>Learning Credal Ensembles via Distributionally Robust Optimization</h2>
<h3>Kaizheng Wang, Ghifari Adam Faza, Fabio Cuzzolin, Siu Lun Chau, David Moens, Hans Hallez</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.08470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credal predictors are models that are aware of epistemic uncertainty and produce a convex set of probabilistic predictions. They offer a principled way to quantify predictive epistemic uncertainty (EU) and have been shown to improve model robustness in various settings. However, most state-of-the-art methods mainly define EU as disagreement caused by random training initializations, which mostly reflects sensitivity to optimization randomness rather than uncertainty from deeper sources. To address this, we define EU as disagreement among models trained with varying relaxations of the i.i.d. assumption between training and test data. Based on this idea, we propose CreDRO, which learns an ensemble of plausible models through distributionally robust optimization. As a result, CreDRO captures EU not only from training randomness but also from meaningful disagreement due to potential distribution shifts between training and test data. Empirical results show that CreDRO consistently outperforms existing credal methods on tasks such as out-of-distribution detection across multiple benchmarks and selective classification in medical applications.</p>

<h2>Mind the Gap: Learning Implicit Impedance in Visuomotor Policies via Intent-Execution Mismatch</h2>
<h3>Cuijie Xu, Shurui Zheng, Zihao Su, Yuanfan Xu, Tinghao Yi, Xudong Zhang, Jian Wang, Yu Wang, Jinchen Yu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleoperation inherently relies on the human operator acting as a closed-loop controller to actively compensate for hardware imperfections, including latency, mechanical friction, and lack of explicit force feedback. Standard Behavior Cloning (BC), by mimicking the robot's executed trajectory, fundamentally ignores this compensatory mechanism. In this work, we propose a Dual-State Conditioning framework that shifts the learning objective to "Intent Cloning" (master command). We posit that the Intent-Execution Mismatch, the discrepancy between master command and slave response, is not noise, but a critical signal that physically encodes implicit interaction forces and algorithmically reveals the operator's strategy for overcoming system dynamics. By predicting the master intent, our policy learns to generate a "virtual equilibrium point", effectively realizing implicit impedance control. Furthermore, by explicitly conditioning on the history of this mismatch, the model performs implicit system identification, perceiving tracking errors as external forces to close the control loop. To bridge the temporal gap caused by inference latency, we further formulate the policy as a trajectory inpainter to ensure continuous control. We validate our approach on a sensorless, low-cost bi-manual setup. Empirical results across tasks requiring contact-rich manipulation and dynamic tracking reveal a decisive gap: while standard execution-cloning fails due to the inability to overcome contact stiffness and tracking lag, our mismatch-aware approach achieves robust success. This presents a minimalist behavior cloning framework for low-cost hardware, enabling force perception and dynamic compensation without relying on explicit force sensing.

<h2>Artificial Magnetic Conductor Frame to Improve Impedance Matching and Radiation Symmetry in 2$\times$2 Array for 6G Applications</h2>
<h3>Edoardo Giusti, Krishan Kumar Tiwari, C. J. Reddy, Danilo Brizi, Agostino Monorchio, Giuseppe Caire</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.08943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) frame capable of improving the impedance matching of a 2$\times$2 array for 6G applications without degrading isolation performance is presented. The proposed frame is integrated into the array without modifying the single radiating element design. By relying on accurate full-wave simulations, it results that the addition of the frame restores the impedance matching performance, achieving a bandwidth of 1.5 GHz at 28 GHz. The isolation between each port remains under -15 dB within the operating band, thanks to the vias in the rectangular patch metasurface. Moreover, the overall structure exhibits a gain of 11.81 dBi with an aperture efficiency of 69$\%$, satisfactorily for broadband communication purposes. The proposed AMC frame represents an effective method for improving array performance without the need to alter the shape or dimensions of the single radiating element.</p>

<h2>CTBC: Contact-Triggered Blind Climbing for Wheeled Bipedal Robots with Instruction Learning and Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<h3>Rankun Li, Hao Wang, Qi Li, Zhuo Han, Yifei Chu, Linqi Ye, Wende Xie, Wenlong Liao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2509.02986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, wheeled bipedal robots have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional mobility on flat terrain. However, while stair climbing has been achieved in prior studies, these existing methods often suffer from a severe lack of versatility, making them difficult to adapt to varying hardware specifications or diverse complex terrains. To overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized Contact-Triggered Blind Climbing (CTBC) framework. Upon detecting wheel-obstacle contact, the framework triggers a leg-lifting motion integrated with a strongly-guided feedforward trajectory. This allows the robot to rapidly acquire agile climbing skills, significantly enhancing its capability to traverse unstructured environments. Distinct from previous approaches, CTBC demonstrates superior robustness and adaptability, having been validated across multiple wheeled bipedal platforms with different wheel radii and tire materials. Real-world experiments demonstrate that, relying solely on proprioceptive feedback, the proposed framework enables robots to achieve reliable and continuous climbing over obstacles well beyond their wheel radius.</p>

<h2>Evolution of Fear and Social Rewards in Prey-Predator Relationship</h2>
<h3>Yuji Kanagawa, Kenji Doya</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.09992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fear is a critical brain function that enables us to learn to avoid danger via reinforcement learning (RL). While many researchers have argued that fear has evolved to escape predators, how varying predatory pressures have shaped fear and other rewards, including positive social rewards for collective grouping, remains an open question. In this study, we investigate the relationship between predatory pressure and fear using an evolutionary simulation of RL agents with evolving rewards. In our simulation, prey and predator RL agents co-evolve their reward functions, including visual rewards for observing prey and predators. While fear-like negative visual rewards for predators often evolved in prey, we also observed cases in which positive rewards for both predators and prey evolved, the latter serving as a social reward for collective grouping. A comparison between different environmental conditions revealed that stronger predator hunting capability promoted stronger fear reward, while less food supply promoted more negative social reward. Moreover, fear did not evolve in response to static pitfalls with non-lethal damage, suggesting that actively hunting predators played an important role in its evolution. These results highlight the special role of predators in the diverse evolution of fear and social rewards.</p>
