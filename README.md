Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.</p>

Abstract: Data warehousing enables performant access to high-quality data integrated from dynamic data sources. The medallion architecture, a standard for data warehousing, addresses these goals by organizing data into bronze, silver and gold layers, representing raw, integrated, and fit-to-purpose data, respectively. In terms of data modeling, bronze layer retains the structure of source data with additional metadata. The gold layer follows established modeling approaches such as star schema, snowflake, and flattened tables. The silver layer, acting as a canonical form, requires a flexible and scalable model to support continuous changes and incremental development. This paper introduces an enhanced Hub Star modeling approach tailored for the medallion architecture, simplifying silver-layer data modeling by generalizing hub and star concepts. This approach has been demonstrated using Databricks and the retail-org sample dataset, with all modeling and transformation scripts available on GitHub.</p>
