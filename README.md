Abstract: Our work aims to make significant strides in understanding unexplored locomotion control paradigms based on the integration of posture manipulation and thrust vectoring. These techniques are commonly seen in nature, such as Chukar birds using their wings to run on a nearly vertical wall. In this work, we show quadratic programming with contact constraints which is then given to the whole body controller to map on robot states to produce a thruster-assisted slope walking controller for our state-of-the-art Harpy platform. Harpy is a bipedal robot capable of legged-aerial locomotion using its legs and thrusters attached to its main frame. The optimization-based walking controller has been used for dynamic locomotion such as slope walking, but the addition of thrusters to perform inclined slope walking has not been extensively explored. In this work, we derive a thruster-assisted bipedal walking with the quadratic programming (QP) controller and implement it in simulation to study its performance.</p>

<p>arXiv:2411.13306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an emerging technology for tactile sensing in human-machine interfaces (HMI). It offers a unique alternative to traditional array-based tactile sensors with its flexible, scalable, and cost-effective one-piece design. This paper proposes a lattice-patterned flexible EIT tactile sensor with a hydrogel-based conductive layer, designed for enhanced sensitivity while maintaining durability. We conducted simulation studies to explore the influence of lattice width and conductive layer thickness on sensor performance, establishing optimized sensor design parameters for enhanced functionality. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the sensor's capacity to detect diverse tactile patterns with a high accuracy. The practical utility of the sensor is demonstrated through its integration within an HMI setup to control a virtual game, showcasing its potential for dynamic, multi-functional tactile interactions in real-time applications. This study reinforces the potential of EIT-based flexible tactile sensors, establishing a foundation for future advancements in wearable, adaptable HMI technologies.</p>

<h2>Spatial error models with heteroskedastic normal perturbations and joint modeling of mean and variance</h2>
<h3>J. D. Toloza, O. O. Melo, N. A. Cruz</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the spatial error model with heteroskedasticity, which allows the joint modeling of the parameters associated with both the mean and the variance, within a traditional approach to spatial econometrics. The estimation algorithm is based on the log-likelihood function and incorporates the use of GAMLSS models in an iterative form. Two theoretical results show the advantages of the model to the usual models of spatial econometrics and allow obtaining the bias of weighted least squares estimators. The proposed methodology is tested through simulations, showing notable results in terms of the ability to recover all parameters and the consistency of its estimates. Finally, this model is applied to identify the factors associated with school desertion in Colombia.</p>
