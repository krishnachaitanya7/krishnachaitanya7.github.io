Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of improving interaction quality in dialogue based learning by detecting and recommending effective pedagogical strategies in tutor student conversations. We introduce PedagoSense, a pedology grounded system that combines a two stage strategy classifier with large language model generation. The system first detects whether a pedagogical strategy is present using a binary classifier, then performs fine grained classification to identify the specific strategy. In parallel, it recommends an appropriate strategy from the dialogue context and uses an LLM to generate a response aligned with that strategy. We evaluate on human annotated tutor student dialogues, augmented with additional non pedagogical conversations for the binary task. Results show high performance for pedagogical strategy detection and consistent gains when using data augmentation, while analysis highlights where fine grained classes remain challenging. Overall, PedagoSense bridges pedagogical theory and practical LLM based response generation for more adaptive educational technologies.</p>

<h2>Not Everyone Wins with LLMs: Behavioral Patterns and Pedagogical Implications for AI Literacy in Programmatic Data Science</h2>

Abstract: LLMs promise to democratize technical work in complex domains like programmatic data analysis, but not everyone benefits equally. We study how students with varied experiences use LLMs to complete Python-based data analysis in computational notebooks in a graduate course. Drawing on homework logs, recordings, and surveys from 36 students, we ask: Which experience matters most, and how does it shape AI use? Our mixed-methods analysis shows that technical experience -- not AI familiarity or communication skills -- remains a significant predictor of success. Students also vary widely in how they leverage LLMs, struggling at stages of forming intent, expressing inputs, interpreting outputs, and assessing results. We identify success and failure behaviors, such as providing context or decomposing prompts, that distinguish effective use. These findings inform AI literacy interventions, highlighting that lightweight demonstrations improve surface fluency but are insufficient; deeper training and scaffolds are needed to cultivate resilient AI use skills.</p>

<h2>MOBIUS: A Multi-Modal Bipedal Robot that can Walk, Crawl, Climb, and Roll</h2>

<p>arXiv:2511.01774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the MOBIUS platform, a bipedal robot capable of walking, crawling, climbing, and rolling. MOBIUS features four limbs, two 6-DoF arms with two-finger grippers for manipulation and climbing, and two 4-DoF legs for locomotion--enabling smooth transitions across diverse terrains without reconfiguration. A hybrid control architecture combines reinforcement learning for locomotion and force control for compliant contact interactions during manipulation. A high-level MIQCP planner autonomously selects locomotion modes to balance stability and energy efficiency. Hardware experiments demonstrate robust gait transitions, dynamic climbing, and full-body load support via pinch grasp. Overall, MOBIUS demonstrates the importance of tight integration between morphology, high-level planning, and control to enable mobile loco-manipulation and grasping, substantially expanding its interaction capabilities, workspace, and traversability.</p>
