<h2>Persistence and extinction dynamics in a stochastic predator-prey model with emergent Allee effects</h2>
<h3>Carlos Granados, Leon A. Valencia</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.17583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Allee effect describes a decline in population fitness at low densities, potentially leading to extinction. In predator-prey systems, an emergent Allee effect can arise due to interactions such as density-dependent maturation rates and predation constraints. This work studies a stochastic predator-prey model where the prey population is structured into juvenile and adult stages, with maturation following a nonlinear function. We introduce Ito-type stochastic perturbations in mortality rates to account for environmental variability. We first establish the positivity of solutions and derive sufficient conditions for the stability of the trivial equilibrium, prey extinction, and conditional predator extinction. We then analyze prey persistence under specific maturation rate functions. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results and their ecological implications.</p>

<h2>Analysis of the impact of fear in the presence of additional food and prey refuge with nonlocal predator-prey models</h2>

<p>arXiv:2310.01392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are many positive and negative factors present in the predator-prey interaction which affect the net growth of the species. Fear of predation is one such factor that creates psychological stress in a prey species, which causes a negative impact on their overall growth. This work considers a predator-prey model where the prey species faces a reduction in their growth out of fear, and the predator has an alternative food source that helps the prey to hide in a safer place. As an extension into the nonlocal spatio-temporal model, a nonlocal term is considered in the prey growth to incorporate a fear-effect range around their spatial location. Linear stability analysis helps to analyze the temporal model and produces a wide range of interesting results, including the presence of a certain amount of fear or even prey refuge, which helps in population coexistence. Furthermore, the numerical simulations of the local and nonlocal spatio-temporal models show different types of spatial-temporal patterns, such as Turing and non-Turing patterns. Nevertheless, an increase in fear level reduces the range of the Turing domain for the local model, whereas the opposite happens when the range of nonlocal interaction is increased.</p>

<p>arXiv:2503.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel 3D graphical representation of mechanical impedance, named impedance space, to enhance the analysis of the dynamic behavior of compliant systems. This approach addresses the limitations of existing 2D graphical methods by associating the impedance control parameters with linear transformations to plot a parametric 3D ellipse, for a known oscillatory input. The well-known 2D impedance ellipses are shown to be particular projections of this 3D ellipse. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed representation.</p>

<h2>Decentralized Navigation of a Cable-Towed Load using Quadrupedal Robot Team via MARL</h2>
<h3>Wen-Tse Chen, Minh Nguyen, Zhongyu Li, Guo Ning Sue, Koushil Sreenath</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.18221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of enabling a team of quadrupedal robots to collaboratively tow a cable-connected load through cluttered and unstructured environments while avoiding obstacles. Leveraging cables allows the multi-robot system to navigate narrow spaces by maintaining slack when necessary. However, this introduces hybrid physical interactions due to alternating taut and slack states, with computational complexity that scales exponentially as the number of agents increases. To tackle these challenges, we developed a scalable and decentralized system capable of dynamically coordinating a variable number of quadrupedal robots while managing the hybrid physical interactions inherent in the load-towing task. At the core of this system is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based planner, designed for decentralized coordination. The MARL-based planner is trained using a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework, enabling each robot to make decisions autonomously using only local (ego) observations. To accelerate learning and ensure effective collaboration across varying team sizes, we introduce a tailored training curriculum for MARL. Experimental results highlight the flexibility and scalability of the framework, demonstrating successful deployment with one to four robots in real-world scenarios and up to twelve robots in simulation. The decentralized planner maintains consistent inference times, regardless of the team size. Additionally, the proposed system demonstrates robustness to environment perturbations and adaptability to varying load weights. This work represents a step forward in achieving flexible and efficient multi-legged robotic collaboration in complex and real-world environments.</p>

<h2>Mapping Hymns and Organizing Concepts in the Rigveda: Quantitatively Connecting the Vedic Suktas</h2>
<h3>Venkatesh Bollineni, Igor Crk, Eren Gultepe</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.18226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing and gaining insight into the Rigveda poses a non-trivial challenge due to its extremely ancient Sanskrit language, poetic structure, and large volume of text. By using NLP techniques, this study identified topics and semantic connections of hymns within the Rigveda that were corroborated by seven well-known groupings of hymns. The 1,028 suktas (hymns) from the modern English translation of the Rigveda by Jamison and Brereton were preprocessed and sukta-level embeddings were obtained using, i) a novel adaptation of LSA, presented herein, ii) SBERT, and iii) Doc2Vec embeddings. Following an UMAP dimension reduction of the vectors, the network of suktas was formed using k-nearest neighbours. Then, community detection of topics in the sukta networks was performed with the Louvain, Leiden, and label propagation methods, whose statistical significance of the formed topics were determined using an appropriate null distribution. Only the novel adaptation of LSA using the Leiden method, had detected sukta topic networks that were significant (z = 2.726, p < .01) with a modularity score of 0.944. Of the seven famous sukta groupings analyzed (e.g., creation, funeral, water, etc.) the LSA derived network was successful in all seven cases, while Doc2Vec was not significant and failed to detect the relevant suktas. SBERT detected four of the famous suktas as separate groups, but mistakenly combined three of them into a single mixed group. Also, the SBERT network was not statistically significant.</p>
