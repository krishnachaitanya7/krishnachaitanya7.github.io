<h2>Optimization of geometric hypergraph embedding</h2>

<p>arXiv:2509.08772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of embedding the nodes of a hypergraph into Euclidean space under the assumption that the interactions arose through closeness to unknown hyperedge centres. In this way, we tackle the inverse problem associated with the generation of geometric random hypergraphs. We propose two new spectral algorithms; both of these exploit the connection between hypergraphs and bipartite graphs. The assumption of an underlying geometric structure allows us to define a concrete measure of success that can be used to optimize the embedding via gradient descent. Synthetic tests show that this approach accurately reveals geometric structure that is planted in the data, and tests on real hypergraphs show that the approach is also useful for the downstream tasks of detecting spurious or missing data and node clustering.</p>

Abstract: Integrating Brain-Machine Interfaces into non-clinical applications like robot motion control remains difficult - despite remarkable advancements in clinical settings. Specifically, EEG-based motor imagery systems are still error-prone, posing safety risks when rigid robots operate near humans. This work presents an alternative pathway towards safe and effective operation by combining wearable EEG with physically embodied safety in soft robots. We introduce and test a pipeline that allows a user to move a soft robot's end effector in real time via brain waves that are measured by as few as three EEG channels. A robust motor imagery algorithm interprets the user's intentions to move the position of a virtual attractor to which the end effector is attracted, thanks to a new Cartesian impedance controller. We specifically focus here on planar soft robot-based architected metamaterials, which require the development of a novel control architecture to deal with the peculiar nonlinearities - e.g., non-affinity in control. We preliminarily but quantitatively evaluate the approach on the task of setpoint regulation. We observe that the user reaches the proximity of the setpoint in 66% of steps and that for successful steps, the average response time is 21.5s. We also demonstrate the execution of simple real-world tasks involving interaction with the environment, which would be extremely hard to perform if it were not for the robot's softness.</p>
