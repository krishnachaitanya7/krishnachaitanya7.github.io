<h2>Adaptive thresholding for wavelet-based nonparametric heteroskedastic variance estimation on the sphere</h2>
<h3>Claudio Durastanti, Radomyra Shevchenko</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.03920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the nonparametric estimation of a heteroskedastic variance function on the sphere in a regression framework, assuming the variance belongs to a Besov regularity class. A needlet-based estimator is proposed, combining multiresolution analysis with hard thresholding. The method exploits the spatial and spectral localization of needlets to adapt to unknown smoothness and is shown to attain minimax-optimal convergence rates over Besov spaces.</p>

<h2>The simultaneous effect of chemotaxis and alarm-taxis on the global existence and stability of a predator-prey system</h2>
<h3>Gnanasekaran Shanmugasundaram, Jitraj Saha, Rafael D\'iaz Fuentes</h3>
<p>arXiv:2510.14728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines a fully parabolic predator-prey chemo-alarm-taxis system under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with a smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$. Under specific parameter conditions, it is shown that the system admits a unique, globally bounded classical solution. The convergence of the solution is established through the construction of an appropriate Lyapunov functional. In addition, numerical simulations are presented to validate the asymptotic behaviour of the solution. The results highlight the significant role of chemotaxis and alarm-taxis coefficients in determining the existence and stability of predator-prey models, as discussed in the literature.</p>

<h2>Transmutation operators for Schr\"odinger equations with distributional potentials and the associated impedance equation</h2>
<h3>V\'ictor A. Vicente-Ben\'itez</h3>
<p>arXiv:2511.12094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the construction of an integral transmutation operator for the Schr\"odinger equation
  \[
  -y'' + q(x)y = \lambda y, \quad x \in J, \ \lambda \in \mathbb{C},
  \]
  in the case where $q$ is the distributional derivative of an $L^2$ function on a bounded interval $J \subset \mathbb{R}$. Such a transmutation operator transforms solutions of $ v'' + \lambda v = 0 $ into solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. The construction of the integral transmutation operator relies on a new regularization of the distributional Schr\"odinger equation based on the Polya factorization in terms of a solution $f$ that does not vanish on the closure of $J$. The existence of such a function $f$ is established, together with a constructive method for its computation.
  As a consequence of the Polya factorization, we obtain an integro-differential transmutation operator for the associated Sturm--Liouville operator in impedance form related to $f$, along with smoothness conditions for the transmutation kernel. Furthermore, we introduce the Darboux transform for both the Schr\"odinger and impedance operators and describe their relationships with the corresponding transmutation operators. Finally, we develop several series representations for the solutions, including the spectral parameter power series and the Neumann series of spherical Bessel functions.</p>

<h2>CodeEval: A pedagogical approach for targeted evaluation of code-trained Large Language Models</h2>
<h3>Danny Brahman, Mohammad Mahoor</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly assessed based on their common sense reasoning, language comprehension, and logical reasoning abilities. While models trained in specialized domains like mathematics or coding have demonstrated remarkable advancements in logical reasoning, there remains a significant gap in evaluating their code generation capabilities. Existing benchmark datasets fall short in pinpointing specific strengths and weaknesses, impeding targeted enhancements in models' reasoning abilities to synthesize code. To bridge this gap, our paper introduces an innovative, pedagogical benchmarking method that mirrors the evaluation processes encountered in academic programming courses. We introduce CodeEval, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs across 24 distinct aspects of Python programming. The dataset covers three proficiency levels - beginner, intermediate, and advanced - and includes both class-based and function-based problem types with detailed problem specifications and comprehensive test suites. To facilitate widespread adoption, we also developed RunCodeEval, an open-source execution framework that provides researchers with a ready-to-use evaluation pipeline for CodeEval. RunCodeEval handles test execution, context setup, and metrics generation, enabling researchers to quickly obtain detailed insights into model strengths and weaknesses across complexity levels, problem types, and programming categories. This combination enables targeted evaluation and guides improvements in LLMs' programming proficiencies.</p>

<h2>A Load Impedance Emulation Active Interface for Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvesters</h2>
<h3>Alessandro Lo Schiavo, Luigi Costanzo, Massimo Vitelli</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.04136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single stage active AC/DC interface able to emulate the optimal load impedance of a Resonant Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvester (RPVEH) is proposed. As theoretically shown, unlike an electronic interface that emulates an optimal load generator, an interface that emulates an optimal load impedance does not require adaptation to the acceleration of input vibrations. This allows the use of a very simple control, avoiding the implementation of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms that require lossy microcontrollers. Thus, the proposed interface is equipped with a simple analog controller allowing the RPVEH to work in its Maximum Power Point (MPP) in both steady-state and variable conditions of vibrations, without recurring to multivariable perturbative approaches, as it happens for the most of single stage AC/DC interfaces proposed in the literature. The absence of perturbative techniques allows a significant improvement of both stationary and dynamic performances. Experimental tests of a prototype of the proposed interface confirm the theoretical findings and the predicted behavior.</p>

<h2>Governance of Technological Transition: A Predator-Prey Analysis of AI Capital in China's Economy and Its Policy Implications</h2>
<h3>Kunpeng Wang, Jiahui Hu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.03547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into China's economy presents a classic governance challenge: how to harness its growth potential while managing its disruptive effects on traditional capital and labor markets. This study addresses this policy dilemma by modeling the dynamic interactions between AI capital, physical capital, and labor within a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey framework. Using annual Chinese data (2016-2023), we quantify the interaction strengths, identify stable equilibria, and perform a global sensitivity analysis. Our results reveal a consistent pattern where AI capital acts as the 'prey', stimulating both physical capital accumulation and labor compensation (wage bill), while facing only weak constraining feedback. The equilibrium points are stable nodes, indicating a policy-mediated convergence path rather than volatile cycles. Critically, the sensitivity analysis shows that the labor market equilibrium is overwhelmingly driven by AI-related parameters, whereas the physical capital equilibrium is also influenced by its own saturation dynamics. These findings provide a systemic, quantitative basis for policymakers: (1) to calibrate AI promotion policies by recognizing the asymmetric leverage points in capital vs. labor markets; (2) to anticipate and mitigate structural rigidities that may arise from current regulatory settings; and (3) to prioritize interventions that foster complementary growth between AI and traditional economic structures while ensuring broad-base distribution of technological gains.</p>

<h2>Diagnosing Heteroskedasticity and Resolving Multicollinearity Paradoxes in Physicochemical Property Prediction</h2>
<h3>Malikussaid, Septian Caesar Floresko, Ade Romadhony, Isman Kurniawan, Warih Maharani, Hilal Hudan Nuha</h3>
<p>arXiv:2512.24643v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lipophilicity (logP) prediction remains central to drug discovery, yet linear regression models for this task frequently violate statistical assumptions in ways that invalidate their reported performance metrics. We analyzed 426,850 bioactive molecules from a rigorously curated intersection of PubChem, ChEMBL, and eMolecules databases, revealing severe heteroskedasticity in linear models predicting computed logP values (XLOGP3): residual variance increases 4.2-fold in lipophilic regions (logP greater than 5) compared to balanced regions (logP 2 to 4). Classical remediation strategies (Weighted Least Squares and Box-Cox transformation) failed to resolve this violation (Breusch-Pagan p-value less than 0.0001 for all variants). Tree-based ensemble methods (Random Forest R-squared of 0.764, XGBoost R-squared of 0.765) proved inherently robust to heteroskedasticity while delivering superior predictive performance. SHAP analysis resolved a critical multicollinearity paradox: despite a weak bivariate correlation of 0.146, molecular weight emerged as the single most important predictor (mean absolute SHAP value of 0.573), with its effect suppressed in simple correlations by confounding with topological polar surface area (TPSA). These findings demonstrate that standard linear models face fundamental challenges for computed lipophilicity prediction and provide a principled framework for interpreting ensemble models in QSAR applications.</p>
