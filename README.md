Abstract: This work considers using reduced basis techniques in connection to (smoothened) total variation regularization in electrical impedance tomography, but analogous ideas can also be used for other inverse elliptic boundary value problems. It is demonstrated that resorting to reduced bases can speed up a reconstruction algorithm based on combining the lagged diffusivity algorithm with sequential linearizations and preconditioned LSQR iteration without any significant loss of reconstruction quality or of the edge-enhancing nature of total variation regularization. The ideas are numerically tested in three dimensions on unstructured finite element meshes with both simulated and experimental data, resulting in online reconstruction times of only a few seconds on a standard laptop computer.</p>

<p>arXiv:2602.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) enables non-invasive, spatially continuous reconstruction of internal conductivity distributions, providing full field sensing beyond conventional point measurements. Here, we report the first in situ implementation of EIT within a tunable architected lattice materials framework, enabling systematic exploration across a broad lattice design space while achieving real time monitoring of damage evolution, including early stage, prefracture events, in 3D printed multifunctional lattice composites. Lattices are designed via Voronoi based branch trunk branch motifs inspired by 2D wallpaper symmetries and fabricated using CNT infused photocurable resins, with nanoscale filler dispersion confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy. Sixteen electrodes distributed along the lattice periphery enable EIT measurements during quasi static tensile loading. Conductivity maps reconstructed using adjacent and across current injection schemes resolve sequential ligament fracture with high temporal resolution, with localised conductivity loss quantitatively coinciding with fracture sites, including regions remote from electrodes. Architectural tunability allows systematic control of EIT imaging sensitivity to early stage damage, while pronounced resistance discontinuities at failure further corroborate spatial localisation; global end to end resistance measurements complement macroscopic stress strain responses. Collectively, these results establish in situ EIT as a scalable, full field sensing modality for architected multifunctional materials, providing an experimentally validated pathway toward autonomous, intelligent materials and data rich material states that can inform digital twin frameworks for structural, biomedical, and energy related applications.</p>
