Abstract: Least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) is one of the classic seismic imaging methods to reconstruct model perturbations within a known reference medium. It can be computed in either data or image domain using different methods by solving a linear inverse problem, whereas a careful comparison analysis of them is lacking in the literature. In this article, we present a comparative study for multiparameter LSRTM in data- and image- domain in the framework of SMIwiz open software. Different from conventional LSRTM for recovering only velocity perturbation with variable density, we focus on simultaneous reconstruction of velocity and impedance perturbations after logorithmic scaling, using the first-order velocity-pressure formulation of acoustic wave equation. The first 3D data-domain LSRTM example has been performed to validate our implementation, involving expensive repetition of Born modelling and migration over a number of iterations. As a more cost-effective alternative, the image-domain LSRTM is implemented using point spread function (PSF) and nonstationary deblurring filter. Dramatic disctinctions between data and image domain methods are discovered with 2D Marmousi test: (1) The data-domain multiparameter inversion provides much better reconstruction of reflectivity images than image-domain approaches, thanks to the complete use of Hessian in Krylov space; (2) The poor multiparameter image-domain inversion highlights the limitation of incomplete Hessian sampling and strong parameter crosstalks, making it difficult to work in practice; (3) In contrast, monoparameter image-domain inversion for seismic impedance is found to work well.</p>

Abstract: Quadrupedal locomotion via Reinforcement Learning (RL) is commonly addressed using the teacher-student paradigm, where a privileged teacher guides a proprioceptive student policy. However, key challenges such as representation misalignment between privileged teacher and proprioceptive-only student, covariate shift due to behavioral cloning, and lack of deployable adaptation; lead to poor generalization in real-world scenarios. We propose Teacher-Aligned Representations via Contrastive Learning (TAR), a framework that leverages privileged information with self-supervised contrastive learning to bridge this gap. By aligning representations to a privileged teacher in simulation via contrastive objectives, our student policy learns structured latent spaces and exhibits robust generalization to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios, surpassing the fully privileged "Teacher". Results showed accelerated training by 2x compared to state-of-the-art baselines to achieve peak performance. OOD scenarios showed better generalization by 40% on average compared to existing methods. Moreover, TAR transitions seamlessly into learning during deployment without requiring privileged states, setting a new benchmark in sample-efficient, adaptive locomotion and enabling continual fine-tuning in real-world scenarios.
