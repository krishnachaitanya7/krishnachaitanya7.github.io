<h2>Revisiting $(\infty,2)$-naturality of the Yoneda embedding</h2>
<h3>Tobias Lenz</h3>
<p>arXiv:2508.11526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Yoneda embedding 'is' $(\infty,2)$-natural with respect to the functoriality of presheaves via left Kan extension, refining the $(\infty,1)$-categorical result proven independently by Haugseng-Hebestreit-Linskens-Nuiten and Ramzi, and answering a question of Ben-Moshe.
  As the key technical ingredient, we show that the identity functor of the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-categories admits only one enhancement to an $(\infty,2)$-functor (namely, the identity functor).</p>
