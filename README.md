<h2>Elucidating microstructural influences on fatigue behavior for additively manufactured Hastelloy X using Bayesian-calibrated crystal plasticity model</h2>

<p>arXiv:2412.10405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal plasticity (CP) modeling is a vital tool for predicting the mechanical behavior of materials, but its calibration involves numerous (>8) constitutive parameters, often requiring time-consuming trial-and-error methods. This paper proposes a robust calibration approach using Bayesian optimization (BO) to identify optimal CP model parameters under fatigue loading conditions. Utilizing cyclic data from additively manufactured Hastelloy X specimens at 500 degree-F, the BO framework, integrated with a Gaussian process surrogate model, significantly reduces the number of required simulations. A novel objective function is developed to match experimental stress-strain data across different strain amplitudes. Results demonstrate that effective CP model calibration is achieved within 75 iterations, with as few as 50 initial simulations. Sensitivity analysis reveals the influence of CP parameters at various loading points on the stress-strain curve. The results show that the stress-strain response is predominantly controlled by parameters related to yield, with increased influence from backstress parameters during compressive loading. In addition, the effect of introducing twins into the synthetic microstructure on fatigue behavior is studied, and a relationship between microstructural features and the fatigue indicator parameter is established. Results show that larger diameter grains, which exhibit a higher Schmid factor and an average misorientation of approximately 42 degrees +/- 1.67 degree, are identified as probable sites for failure. The proposed optimization framework can be applied to any material system or CP model, streamlining the calibration process and improving the predictive accuracy of such models.</p>

Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.</p>

<h2>Thermodynamics-informed graph neural networks for real-time simulation of digital human twins</h2>
<h3>Lucas Tes\'an, David Gonz\'alez, Pedro Martins, El\'ias Cueto</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.12034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing importance of real-time simulation in the medical field has exposed the limitations and bottlenecks inherent in the digital representation of complex biological systems. This paper presents a novel methodology aimed at advancing current lines of research in soft tissue simulation. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid model that integrates the geometric bias of graph neural networks with the physical bias derived from the imposition of a metriplectic structure as soft and hard constrains in the architecture, being able to simulate hepatic tissue with dissipative properties. This approach provides an efficient solution capable of generating predictions at high feedback rate while maintaining a remarkable generalization ability for previously unseen anatomies. This makes these features particularly relevant in the context of precision medicine and haptic rendering.
  Based on the adopted methodologies, we propose a model that predicts human liver responses to traction and compression loads in as little as 7.3 milliseconds for optimized configurations and as fast as 1.65 milliseconds in the most efficient cases, all in the forward pass. The model achieves relative position errors below 0.15\%, with stress tensor and velocity estimations maintaining relative errors under 7\%. This demonstrates the robustness of the approach developed, which is capable of handling diverse load states and anatomies effectively. This work highlights the feasibility of integrating real-time simulation with patient-specific geometries through deep learning, paving the way for more robust digital human twins in medical applications.</p>

<h2>An adaptive acceleration scheme for phase-field fatigue computations</h2>

<p>arXiv:2404.07003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-field models of fatigue are capable of reproducing the main phenomenology of fatigue behavior. However, phase-field computations in the high-cycle fatigue regime are prohibitively expensive, due to the need to resolve spatially the small length scale inherent to phase-field models and temporally the loading history for several millions of cycles. As a remedy, we propose a fully adaptive acceleration scheme based on the cycle jump technique, where the cycle-by-cycle resolution of an appropriately determined number of cycles is skipped while predicting the local system evolution during the jump. The novelty of our approach is a cycle-jump criterion to determine the appropriate cycle-jump size based on a target increment of a global variable which monitors the advancement of fatigue. We propose the definition and meaning of this variable for three general stages of the fatigue life. In comparison to existing acceleration techniques, our approach needs no parameters and bounds for the cycle-jump size, and it works independently of the material, specimen or loading conditions. Since one of the monitoring variables is the fatigue crack length, we introduce an accurate, flexible and efficient method for its computation, which overcomes the issues of conventional crack tip tracking algorithms and enables the consideration of several cracks evolving at the same time. The performance of the proposed acceleration scheme is demonstrated with representative numerical examples, which show a speedup reaching four orders of magnitude in the high-cycle fatigue regime with consistently high accuracy.</p>
