<h2>SDEIT: Semantic-Driven Electrical Impedance Tomography</h2>
<h3>Dong Liu, Yuanchao Wu, Bowen Tong, Jiansong Deng</h3>
<p>arXiv:2504.04185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularization methods using prior knowledge are essential in solving ill-posed inverse problems such as Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). However, designing effective regularization and integrating prior information into EIT remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of anatomical structures. In this work, we introduce SDEIT, a novel semantic-driven framework that integrates Stable Diffusion 3.5 into EIT, marking the first use of large-scale text-to-image generation models in EIT. SDEIT employs natural language prompts as semantic priors to guide the reconstruction process. By coupling an implicit neural representation (INR) network with a plug-and-play optimization scheme that leverages SD-generated images as generative priors, SDEIT improves structural consistency and recovers fine details. Importantly, this method does not rely on paired training datasets, increasing its adaptability to varied EIT scenarios. Extensive experiments on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that SDEIT outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, offering superior accuracy and robustness. This work opens a new pathway for integrating multimodal priors into ill-posed inverse problems like EIT.</p>

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a graph autoencoder architecture capable of performing projection-based model-order reduction (PMOR) using a nonlinear manifold least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection scheme. The architecture is particularly useful for advection-dominated flows, as it captures the underlying geometry of the modeled domain to provide a robust nonlinear mapping that can be leveraged in a PMOR setting. The presented graph autoencoder is constructed with a two-part process that consists of (1) generating a hierarchy of reduced graphs to emulate the compressive abilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and (2) training a message passing operation at each step in the hierarchy of reduced graphs to emulate the filtering process of a CNN. The resulting framework provides improved flexibility over traditional CNN-based autoencoders because it is extendable to unstructured meshes. To highlight the capabilities of the proposed framework, which is named geometric deep least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (GD-LSPG), we benchmark the method on a one-dimensional Burgers' model with a structured mesh and demonstrate the flexibility of GD-LSPG by deploying it on two test cases for two-dimensional Euler equations that use an unstructured mesh. The proposed framework is more flexible than using a traditional CNN-based autoencoder and provides considerable improvement in accuracy for very low-dimensional latent spaces in comparison with traditional affine projections.</p>

<h2>STGCN-LSTM for Olympic Medal Prediction: Dynamic Power Modeling and Causal Policy Optimization</h2>
<h3>Yiquan Wang, Jiaying Wang, Tin-Yeh Huang, Jingyi Yang, Zihao Xu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.17711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel hybrid model, STGCN-LSTM, to forecast Olympic medal distributions by integrating the spatio-temporal relationships among countries and the long-term dependencies of national performance. The Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) captures geographic and interactive factors-such as coaching exchange and socio-economic links-while the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module models historical trends in medal counts, economic data, and demographics. To address zero-inflated outputs (i.e., the disparity between countries that consistently yield wins and those never having won medals), a Zero-Inflated Compound Poisson (ZICP) framework is incorporated to separate random zeros from structural zeros, providing a clearer view of potential breakthrough performances. Validation includes historical backtracking, policy shock simulations, and causal inference checks, confirming the robustness of the proposed method. Results shed light on the influence of coaching mobility, event specialization, and strategic investment on medal forecasts, offering a data-driven foundation for optimizing sports policies and resource allocation in diverse Olympic contexts.</p>
