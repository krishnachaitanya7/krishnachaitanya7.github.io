<h2>Journey of Lars Ahlfors' Fields Medal</h2>
<h3>Frank Wang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.12850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the story of the first Fields Medal awarded to Lars Ahlfors. It was smuggled out of Finland in 1944, pawned in Sweden during World War II, and returned to Helsinki in 2004. This article is based on an interview with Ahlfors' second daughter Vanessa Gruen, and established biographical sources.</p>

<h2>Real-World En Call Center Transcripts Dataset with PII Redaction</h2>
<h3>Ha Dao, Gaurav Chawla, Raghu Banda, Caleb DeLeeuw</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.02958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CallCenterEN, a large-scale (91,706 conversations, corresponding to 10448 audio hours), real-world English call center transcript dataset designed to support research and development in customer support and sales AI systems. This is the largest release to-date of open source call center transcript data of this kind. The dataset includes inbound and outbound calls between agents and customers, with accents from India, the Philippines and the United States. The dataset includes high-quality, PII-redacted human-readable transcriptions. All personally identifiable information (PII) has been rigorously removed to ensure compliance with global data protection laws. The audio is not included in the public release due to biometric privacy concerns. Given the scarcity of publicly available real-world call center datasets, CallCenterEN fills a critical gap in the landscape of available ASR corpora, and is released under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license for non-commercial research use.</p>

<h2>High-Resolution Sustain Pedal Depth Estimation from Piano Audio Across Room Acoustics</h2>
<h3>Kun Fang, Hanwen Zhang, Ziyu Wang, Ichiro Fujinaga</h3>
<p>arXiv:2507.04230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piano sustain pedal detection has previously been approached as a binary on/off classification task, limiting its application in real-world piano performance scenarios where pedal depth significantly influences musical expression. This paper presents a novel approach for high-resolution estimation that predicts continuous pedal depth values. We introduce a Transformer-based architecture that not only matches state-of-the-art performance on the traditional binary classification task but also achieves high accuracy in continuous pedal depth estimation. Furthermore, by estimating continuous values, our model provides musically meaningful predictions for sustain pedal usage, whereas baseline models struggle to capture such nuanced expressions with their binary detection approach. Additionally, this paper investigates the influence of room acoustics on sustain pedal estimation using a synthetic dataset that includes varied acoustic conditions. We train our model with different combinations of room settings and test it in an unseen new environment using a "leave-one-out" approach. Our findings show that the two baseline models and ours are not robust to unseen room conditions. Statistical analysis further confirms that reverberation influences model predictions and introduces an overestimation bias.</p>

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated impressive locomotion capabilities in complex environments, but equipping them with autonomous versatile manipulation skills in a scalable way remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment imitation learning system for quadrupedal manipulation, leveraging data collected from both humans and LocoMan, a quadruped equipped with multiple manipulation modes. Specifically, we develop a teleoperation and data collection pipeline, which unifies and modularizes the observation and action spaces of the human and the robot. To effectively leverage the collected data, we propose an efficient modularized architecture that supports co-training and pretraining on structured modality-aligned data across different embodiments. Additionally, we construct the first manipulation dataset for the LocoMan robot, covering various household tasks in both unimanual and bimanual modes, supplemented by a corresponding human dataset. We validate our system on six real-world manipulation tasks, where it achieves an average success rate improvement of 41.9% overall and 79.7% under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings compared to the baseline. Pretraining with human data contributes a 38.6% success rate improvement overall and 82.7% under OOD settings, enabling consistently better performance with only half the amount of robot data. Our code, hardware, and data are open-sourced at: https://human2bots.github.io.</p>

<h2>ANN-Based Grid Impedance Estimation for Adaptive Gain Scheduling in VSG Under Dynamic Grid Conditions</h2>
<h3>Quang-Manh Hoang, Van Nam Nguyen, Taehyung Kim, Guilherme Vieira Hollweg, Wencong Su, Van-Hai Bui</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.23304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to grid-following inverters, Virtual Synchronous Generators (VSGs) perform well under weak grid conditions but may become unstable when the grid is strong. Grid strength depends on grid impedance, which unfortunately varies over time. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive gain-scheduling control scheme for VSGs. First, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) estimates the fundamental-frequency grid impedance; then these estimates are fed into an adaptive gain-scheduling function to recalculate controller parameters under varying grid conditions. The proposed method is validated in Simulink and compared with a conventional VSG employing fixed controller gains. The results demonstrate that settling times and overshoot percentages remain consistent across different grid conditions. Additionally, previously unseen grid impedance values are estimated with high accuracy and minimal time delay, making the approach well suited for real-time gain-scheduling control.</p>
