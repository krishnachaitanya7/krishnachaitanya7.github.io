<h2>Support estimation in high-dimensional heteroscedastic mean regression</h2>

<p>arXiv:2011.01591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A current strand of research in high-dimensional statistics deals with robustifying the available methodology with respect to deviations from the pervasive light-tail assumptions. In this paper we consider a linear mean regression model with random design and potentially heteroscedastic, heavy-tailed errors, and investigate support estimation in this framework. We use a strictly convex, smooth variant of the Huber loss function with tuning parameter depending on the parameters of the problem, as well as the adaptive LASSO penalty for computational efficiency. For the resulting estimator we show sign-consistency and optimal rates of convergence in the $\ell_\infty$ norm as in the homoscedastic, light-tailed setting. In our analysis, we have to deal with the issue that the support of the target parameter in the linear mean regression model and its robustified version may differ substantially even for small values of the tuning parameter of the Huber loss function. Simulations illustrate the favorable numerical performance of the proposed methodology.</p>

<h2>Constructing a fully homomorphic encryption scheme with the Yoneda Lemma</h2>

<p>arXiv:2401.13255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper redefines the foundations of asymmetric cryptography's homomorphic cryptosystems through the application of the Yoneda Lemma. It demonstrates that widely adopted systems, including ElGamal, RSA, Benaloh, Regev's LWE, and NTRUEncrypt, are directly derived from the principles of the Yoneda Lemma. This synthesis leads to the creation of a holistic homomorphic encryption framework, the Yoneda Encryption Scheme. Within this framework, encryption is modeled using the bijective maps of the Yoneda Lemma Isomorphism, with decryption following naturally from the properties of these maps. This unification suggests a conjecture for a unified model theory framework, offering a foundation for reasoning about both homomorphic and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes. As a practical demonstration, the paper introduces the FHE scheme ACES, which supports arbitrary finite sequences of encrypted multiplications and additions without relying on conventional bootstrapping techniques for ciphertext refreshment. This highlights the practical implications of the theoretical advancements and proposes a new approach for leveraging model theory and forcing techniques in cryptography, particularly in the design of FHE schemes.</p>
