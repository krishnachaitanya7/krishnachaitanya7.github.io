<h2>A Study on the Specialist Predator with the Allee Effect on the Prey</h2>
<h3>Tanmay Das, Mahatsab Mandal</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.01250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predator-prey models in theoretical ecology have a long and complex history, spanning decades of research. Most of the models rely upon simple reproduction and mortality rates associated with different types of functional responses. A key development in this field occurred with the introduction of a density dependent reproduction rate, originally introduced by Allee. In this manuscript, a new function representing the Allee effect is introduced and justified from the ecological point of view. This paper aims to analyze predator-prey models incorporating Holling type-I and II functional responses, influenced by this new Allee function. A rich dynamics shows up in the presence of the said function, including the emergence of the limit cycles through the Hopf bifurcation for a particular parameter domain.</p>

<h2>MR-EIT: Multi-Resolution Reconstruction for Electrical Impedance Tomography via Data-Driven and Unsupervised Dual-Mode Neural Networks</h2>
<h3>Fangming Shi, Jinzhen Liu, Xiangqian Meng, Yapeng Zhou, Hui Xiong</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.00762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a multi-resolution reconstruction method for Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), referred to as MR-EIT, which is capable of operating in both supervised and unsupervised learning modes. MR-EIT integrates an ordered feature extraction module and an unordered coordinate feature expression module. The former achieves the mapping from voltage to two-dimensional conductivity features through pre-training, while the latter realizes multi-resolution reconstruction independent of the order and size of the input sequence by utilizing symmetric functions and local feature extraction mechanisms. In the data-driven mode, MR-EIT reconstructs high-resolution images from low-resolution data of finite element meshes through two stages of pre-training and joint training, and demonstrates excellent performance in simulation experiments. In the unsupervised learning mode, MR-EIT does not require pre-training data and performs iterative optimization solely based on measured voltages to rapidly achieve image reconstruction from low to high resolution. It shows robustness to noise and efficient super-resolution reconstruction capabilities in both simulation and real water tank experiments. Experimental results indicate that MR-EIT outperforms the comparison methods in terms of Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Relative Image Error (RIE), especially in the unsupervised learning mode, where it can significantly reduce the number of iterations and improve image reconstruction quality.</p>

<h2>Extended Impedance Modal Analysis of Internal Dynamics in Grid-Following Inverters</h2>
<h3>Le Zheng, Jiajie Zheng, Lei Chen, Chongru Liu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.00797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the penetration of Grid-Following inverters (GFL) in power systems continues to increase, the dynamic characteristics of power systems undergo significant transformations. Recently, modal analysis based on the impedance model (MAI) has been utilized to evaluate the interaction between GFLs and the power grid through impedance/admittance participation factors (PF). However, MAI relies on the impedance model that characterizes the input-output behavior of the ports, treating the GFL as a single integrated entity. This approach limits its ability to reveal the complex dynamic coupling mechanism between different control loops inside the GFL. In this paper, we propose an extended impedance modal analysis (EMAI) method. Firstly, the equivalent dynamics of the GFL are decomposed into two components: the synchronous dynamic dominated by the phase-locked loop (PLL) and the electromagnetic dynamic dominated by the current control loop (CCL). The PF and participation ratios (PR) of these two dynamic components are then calculated to identify the dominant dynamics of the system. Building on this, we introduce the explicit parameter participation factors (PPF) to further pinpoint the key parameters of the dominant control loop, which provides a way for enhancing system stability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through the simulation of the modified 14-bus and 68-bus systems. The EMAI method enables the analysis of the dynamic characteristics of each control loop in the GFL based on the impedance model. It can effectively identify the critical control loops influencing system stability without requiring the construction of a full state-space model, demonstrating its broad applicability and value.</p>

<h2>How Do Teachers Create Pedagogical Chatbots?: Current Practices and Challenges</h2>
<h3>Minju Yoo, Hyoungwook Jin, Juho Kim</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.00967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI chatbots have emerged as promising educational tools for personalized learning experiences, with advances in large language models (LLMs) enabling teachers to create and customize these chatbots for their specific classroom needs. However, there is a limited understanding of how teachers create pedagogical chatbots and integrate them into their lessons. Through semi-structured interviews with seven K-12 teachers, we examined their practices and challenges when designing, implementing, and deploying chatbots. Our findings revealed that teachers prioritize developing task-specific chatbots aligned with their lessons. Teachers engaged in various creation practices and had different challenges; novices struggled mainly with initial design and technical implementation, while experienced teachers faced challenges with technical aspects and analyzing conversational data. Based on these insights, we explore approaches to supporting teachers' chatbot creation process and opportunities for designing future chatbot creation systems. This work provides practical insights into deepening the understanding of teacher-driven AI chatbots and AI-augmented learning environments.</p>

<h2>ecg2o: A Seamless Extension of g2o for Equality-Constrained Factor Graph Optimization</h2>
<h3>Anas Abdelkarim, Holger Voos, Daniel G\"orges</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factor graph optimization serves as a fundamental framework for robotic perception, enabling applications such as pose estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), structure-from-motion (SfM), and situational awareness. Traditionally, these methods solve unconstrained least squares problems using algorithms such as Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt. However, extending factor graphs with native support for equality constraints can improve solution accuracy and broaden their applicability, particularly in optimal control. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of factor graphs that seamlessly incorporates equality constraints without requiring additional optimization algorithms. Our approach maintains the efficiency and flexibility of existing second-order optimization techniques while ensuring constraint feasibility. To validate our method, we apply it to an optimal control problem for velocity tracking in autonomous vehicles and benchmark our results against state-of-the-art constraint handling techniques. Additionally, we introduce ecg2o, a header-only C++ library that extends the widely used g2o factor graph library by adding full support for equality-constrained optimization. This library, along with demonstrative examples and the optimal control problem, is available as open source at https://github.com/snt-arg/ecg2o</p>

<h2>Streaming Piano Transcription Based on Consistent Onset and Offset Decoding with Sustain Pedal Detection</h2>
<h3>Weixing Wei, Jiahao Zhao, Yulun Wu, Kazuyoshi Yoshii</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a streaming audio-to-MIDI piano transcription approach that aims to sequentially translate a music signal into a sequence of note onset and offset events. The sequence-to-sequence nature of this task may call for the computationally-intensive transformer model for better performance, which has recently been used for offline transcription benchmarks and could be extended for streaming transcription with causal attention mechanisms. We assume that the performance limitation of this naive approach lies in the decoder. Although time-frequency features useful for onset detection are considerably different from those for offset detection, the single decoder is trained to output a mixed sequence of onset and offset events without guarantee of the correspondence between the onset and offset events of the same note. To overcome this limitation, we propose a streaming encoder-decoder model that uses a convolutional encoder aggregating local acoustic features, followed by an autoregressive Transformer decoder detecting a variable number of onset events and another decoder detecting the offset events for the active pitches with validation of the sustain pedal at each time frame. Experiments using the MAESTRO dataset showed that the proposed streaming method performed comparably with or even better than the state-of-the-art offline methods while significantly reducing the computational cost.</p>

<h2>Statistical physics analysis of graph neural networks: Approaching optimality in the contextual stochastic block model</h2>
<h3>O. Duranthon, L. Zdeborov\'a</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.01361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to process data associated with graphs. They are finding an increasing range of applications; however, as with other modern machine learning techniques, their theoretical understanding is limited. GNNs can encounter difficulties in gathering information from nodes that are far apart by iterated aggregation steps. This situation is partly caused by so-called oversmoothing; and overcoming it is one of the practically motivated challenges. We consider the situation where information is aggregated by multiple steps of convolution, leading to graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We analyze the generalization performance of a basic GCN, trained for node classification on data generated by the contextual stochastic block model. We predict its asymptotic performance by deriving the free energy of the problem, using the replica method, in the high-dimensional limit. Calling depth the number of convolutional steps, we show the importance of going to large depth to approach the Bayes-optimality. We detail how the architecture of the GCN has to scale with the depth to avoid oversmoothing. The resulting large depth limit can be close to the Bayes-optimality and leads to a continuous GCN. Technically, we tackle this continuous limit via an approach that resembles dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with constraints at the initial and final times. An expansion around large regularization allows us to solve the corresponding equations for the performance of the deep GCN. This promising tool may contribute to the analysis of further deep neural networks.</p>

<h2>Preference Aligned Diffusion Planner for Quadrupedal Locomotion Control</h2>
<h3>Xinyi Yuan, Zhiwei Shang, Zifan Wang, Chenkai Wang, Zhao Shan, Meixin Zhu, Chenjia Bai, Xuelong Li, Weiwei Wan, Kensuke Harada</h3>
<p>arXiv:2410.13586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex distributions from large-scale datasets, providing a promising solution for quadrupedal locomotion control. However, the robustness of the diffusion planner is inherently dependent on the diversity of the pre-collected datasets. To mitigate this issue, we propose a two-stage learning framework to enhance the capability of the diffusion planner under limited dataset (reward-agnostic). Through the offline stage, the diffusion planner learns the joint distribution of state-action sequences from expert datasets without using reward labels. Subsequently, we perform the online interaction in the simulation environment based on the trained offline planner, which significantly diversified the original behavior and thus improves the robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel weak preference labeling method without the ground-truth reward or human preferences. The proposed method exhibits superior stability and velocity tracking accuracy in pacing, trotting, and bounding gait under different speeds and can perform a zero-shot transfer to the real Unitree Go1 robots.

<h2>Gold-medalist Performance in Solving Olympiad Geometry with AlphaGeometry2</h2>
<h3>Yuri Chervonyi, Trieu H. Trinh, Miroslav Ol\v{s}\'ak, Xiaomeng Yang, Hoang Nguyen, Marcelo Menegali, Junehyuk Jung, Vikas Verma, Quoc V. Le, Thang Luong</h3>
<p>arXiv:2502.03544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present AlphaGeometry2, a significantly improved version of AlphaGeometry introduced in Trinh et al. (2024), which has now surpassed an average gold medalist in solving Olympiad geometry problems. To achieve this, we first extend the original AlphaGeometry language to tackle harder problems involving movements of objects, and problems containing linear equations of angles, ratios, and distances. This, together with support for non-constructive problems, has markedly improved the coverage rate of the AlphaGeometry language on International Math Olympiads (IMO) 2000-2024 geometry problems from 66% to 88%. The search process of AlphaGeometry2 has also been greatly improved through the use of Gemini architecture for better language modeling, and a novel knowledge-sharing mechanism that enables effective communication between search trees. Together with further enhancements to the symbolic engine and synthetic data generation, we have significantly boosted the overall solving rate of AlphaGeometry2 to 84% for $\textit{all}$ geometry problems over the last 25 years, compared to 54% previously. AlphaGeometry2 was also part of the system that achieved silver-medal standard at IMO 2024 https://dpmd.ai/imo-silver. Last but not least, we report progress towards using AlphaGeometry2 as a part of a fully automated system that reliably solves geometry problems directly from natural language input.</p>

<h2>Heteroscedastic Growth Curve Modeling with Shape-Restricted Splines</h2>
<h3>Jieying Jiao, Wenling Song, Yishu Xue, Jun Yan</h3>
<p>arXiv:2503.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growth curve analysis (GCA) has a wide range of applications in various fields where growth trajectories need to be modeled. Heteroscedasticity is often present in the error term, which can not be handled with sufficient flexibility by standard linear fixed or mixed-effects models. One situation that has been addressed is where the error variance is characterized by a linear predictor with certain covariates. A frequently encountered scenario in GCA, however, is one in which the variance is a smooth function of the mean with known shape restrictions. A naive application of standard linear mixed-effects models would underestimate the variance of the fixed effects estimators and, consequently, the uncertainty of the estimated growth curve. We propose to model the variance of the response variable as a shape-restricted (increasing/decreasing; convex/concave) function of the marginal or conditional mean using shape-restricted splines. A simple iteratively reweighted fitting algorithm that takes advantage of existing software for linear mixed-effects models is developed. For inference, a parametric bootstrap procedure is recommended. Our simulation study shows that the proposed method gives satisfactory inference with moderate sample sizes. The utility of the method is demonstrated using two real-world applications.</p>
