<h2>A Pole-Based Approach to Interpret Electromechanical Impedance Measurements in Structural Health Monitoring</h2>
<h3>Sourabh Sangle, Sa'ed Alajlouni, Pablo A. Tarazaga</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.05871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over several decades, electromechanical impedance (EMI) measurements have been employed as a basis for structural health monitoring and damage detection. Traditionally, Root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD) and Cross-correlation (XCORR) based metrics have been used to interpret EMI measurements for damage assessment. These tools, although helpful and widely used, were not designed with the idea to assess changes in EMI to underlying physical changes incurred by damage. The authors propose leveraging vector fitting (VF), a rational function approximation technique, to estimate the poles of the underlying system, and consequently, the modal parameters which have a physical connection to the underlying model of a system. Shifts in natural frequencies, as an effect of changes in the pole location, can be attributed to changes in a structure undergoing damage. With VF, tracking changes between measurements of damaged and pristine structures is physically more intuitive unlike when using traditional metrics, making it ideal for informed post-processing. Alternative methods to VF exist in the literature (e.g., Least Square Complex Frequency-domain (LSCF) estimation, adaptive Antoulas--Anderson (AAA), Rational Krylov Fitting (RKFIT)). The authors demonstrate that VF is better suited for EMI-based structural health monitoring for the following reasons: 1. VF is more accurate at high frequency, 2. VF estimates complex conjugate stable pole pairs, close to the actual poles of the system, and 3. VF can capture critical information missed by other approaches and present it in a condensed form. Thus, using the selected technique for interpreting high-frequency EMI measurements for structural health monitoring is proposed. A set of representative case studies is presented to show the benefits of VF for damage detection and diagnosis.</p>

<h2>A Superdirective Beamforming Approach with Impedance Coupling and Field Coupling for Compact Antenna Arrays</h2>
<h3>Liangcheng Han, Haifan Yin, Mengying Gao, Jingcheng Xie</h3>
<p>arXiv:2302.08203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In most multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, antennas are spaced at least half a wavelength apart to reduce mutual coupling. In this configuration, the maximum array gain is equal to the number of antennas. However, when the antenna spacing is significantly reduced, the array gain of a compact array can become proportional to the square of the number of antennas, greatly exceeding that of traditional MIMO systems. Achieving this "superdirectivity" requires complex calculations of the excitation coefficients (beamforming vector), which is a challenging task. In this paper, we address this problem with a novel double coupling-based superdirective beamforming method. In particular, we categorize the antenna coupling effects to impedance coupling and field coupling. By characterizing these two coupling in model, we derive the beamforming vector for superdirective arrays. We prove that the field coupling matrix has the unique solution for an antenna array, and itself has the ability to fully characterize the distorted coupling field. Based on this proven theorem, we propose a method that accurately calculates the coupling matrix using only a number of angle sampling points on the order of the number of antennas. Moreover, a prototype of an independently-controlled superdirective antenna array is developed. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches, and superdirectivity is achieved in reality by a compact array with 4 and 8 dipole antennas.</p>

<h2>Multistage non-deterministic classification using secondary concept graphs and graph convolutional networks for high-level feature extraction</h2>
<h3>Masoud Kargar, Nasim Jelodari, Alireza Assadzadeh</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.06212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs, comprising nodes and edges, visually depict relationships and structures, posing challenges in extracting high-level features due to their intricate connections. Multiple connections introduce complexities in discovering patterns, where node weights may affect some features more than others. In domains with diverse topics, graph representations illustrate interrelations among features. Pattern discovery within graphs is recognized as NP-hard. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a prominent deep learning approach for acquiring meaningful representations by leveraging node connectivity and characteristics. Despite achievements, predicting and assigning 9 deterministic classes often involves errors. To address this challenge, we present a multi-stage non-deterministic classification method based on a secondary conceptual graph and graph convolutional networks, which includes distinct steps: 1) leveraging GCN for the extraction and generation of 12 high-level features: 2) employing incomplete, non-deterministic models for feature extraction, conducted before reaching a definitive prediction: and 3) formulating definitive forecasts grounded in conceptual (logical) graphs. The empirical findings indicate that our proposed approach outperforms contemporary methods in classification tasks. Across three datasets Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed the achieved accuracies are 96%, 93%, and 95%, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/MasoudKargar.</p>

<h2>QuadWBG: Generalizable Quadrupedal Whole-Body Grasping</h2>
<h3>Jilong Wang, Javokhirbek Rajabov, Chaoyi Xu, Yiming Zheng, He Wang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.06782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legged robots with advanced manipulation capabilities have the potential to significantly improve household duties and urban maintenance. Despite considerable progress in developing robust locomotion and precise manipulation methods, seamlessly integrating these into cohesive whole-body control for real-world applications remains challenging. In this paper, we present a modular framework for robust and generalizable whole-body loco-manipulation controller based on a single arm-mounted camera. By using reinforcement learning (RL), we enable a robust low-level policy for command execution over 5 dimensions (5D) and a grasp-aware high-level policy guided by a novel metric, Generalized Oriented Reachability Map (GORM). The proposed system achieves state-of-the-art one-time grasping accuracy of 89% in the real world, including challenging tasks such as grasping transparent objects. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our system can effectively manage a large workspace, from floor level to above body height, and perform diverse whole-body loco-manipulation tasks.</p>

<h2>Scientific machine learning in ecological systems: A study on the predator-prey dynamics</h2>
<h3>Ranabir Devgupta, Raj Abhijit Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.06858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we apply two pillars of Scientific Machine Learning: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to the Lotka Volterra Predator Prey Model, a fundamental ecological model describing the dynamic interactions between predator and prey populations. The Lotka-Volterra model is critical for understanding ecological dynamics, population control, and species interactions, as it is represented by a system of differential equations. In this work, we aim to uncover the underlying differential equations without prior knowledge of the system, relying solely on training data and neural networks. Using robust modeling in the Julia programming language, we demonstrate that both Neural ODEs and UDEs can be effectively utilized for prediction and forecasting of the Lotka-Volterra system. More importantly, we introduce the forecasting breakdown point: the time at which forecasting fails for both Neural ODEs and UDEs. We observe how UDEs outperform Neural ODEs by effectively recovering the underlying dynamics and achieving accurate forecasting with significantly less training data. Additionally, we introduce Gaussian noise of varying magnitudes (from mild to high) to simulate real-world data perturbations and show that UDEs exhibit superior robustness, effectively recovering the underlying dynamics even in the presence of noisy data, while Neural ODEs struggle with high levels of noise. Through extensive hyperparameter optimization, we offer insights into neural network architectures, activation functions, and optimizers that yield the best results. This study opens the door to applying Scientific Machine Learning frameworks for forecasting tasks across a wide range of ecological and scientific domains.</p>

<h2>Bipedal walking with continuously compliant robotic legs</h2>
<h3>Robin Bendfeld, C. David Remy</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.06948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biomechanics and robotics, elasticity plays a crucial role in enhancing locomotion efficiency and stability. Traditional approaches in legged robots often employ series elastic actuators (SEA) with discrete rigid components, which, while effective, add weight and complexity. This paper presents an innovative alternative by integrating continuously compliant structures into the lower legs of a bipedal robot, fundamentally transforming the SEA concept. Our approach replaces traditional rigid segments with lightweight, deformable materials, reducing overall mass and simplifying the actuation design. This novel design introduces unique challenges in modeling, sensing, and control, due to the infinite dimensionality of continuously compliant elements. We address these challenges through effective approximations and control strategies. The paper details the design and modeling of the compliant leg structure, presents low-level force and kinematics controllers, and introduces a high-level posture controller with a gait scheduler. Experimental results demonstrate successful bipedal walking using this new design.</p>

<h2>Learning Multi-Agent Collaborative Manipulation for Long-Horizon Quadrupedal Pushing</h2>
<h3>Chuye Hong, Yuming Feng, Yaru Niu, Shiqi Liu, Yuxiang Yang, Wenhao Yu, Tingnan Zhang, Jie Tan, Ding Zhao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.07104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.</p>

<h2>Playful DoggyBot: Learning Agile and Precise Quadrupedal Locomotion</h2>
<h3>Xin Duan, Ziwen Zhuang, Hang Zhao, Soeren Schwertfeger</h3>
<p>arXiv:2409.19920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal animals have the ability to perform agile while accurate tasks: a trained dog can chase and catch a flying frisbee before it touches the ground; a cat alone at home can jump and grab the door handle accurately. However, agility and precision are usually a trade-off in robotics problems. Recent works in quadruped robots either focus on agile but not-so-accurate tasks, such as locomotion in challenging terrain, or accurate but not-so-fast tasks, such as using an additional manipulator to interact with objects. In this work, we aim at an accurate and agile task, catching a small object hanging above the robot. We mount a passive gripper in front of the robot chassis, so that the robot has to jump and catch the object with extreme precision. Our experiment shows that our system is able to jump and successfully catch the ball at 1.05m high in simulation and 0.8m high in the real world, while the robot is 0.3m high when standing.</p>

<h2>Online Omnidirectional Jumping Trajectory Planning for Quadrupedal Robots on Uneven Terrains</h2>
<h3>Linzhu Yue, Zhitao Song, Jinhu Dong, Zhongyu Li, Hongbo Zhang, Lingwei Zhang, Xuanqi Zeng, Koushil Sreenath, Yun-hui Liu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2411.04494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural terrain complexity often necessitates agile movements like jumping in animals to improve traversal efficiency. To enable similar capabilities in quadruped robots, complex real-time jumping maneuvers are required. Current research does not adequately address the problem of online omnidirectional jumping and neglects the robot's kinodynamic constraints during trajectory generation. This paper proposes a general and complete cascade online optimization framework for omnidirectional jumping for quadruped robots. Our solution systematically encompasses jumping trajectory generation, a trajectory tracking controller, and a landing controller. It also incorporates environmental perception to navigate obstacles that standard locomotion cannot bypass, such as jumping from high platforms. We introduce a novel jumping plane to parameterize omnidirectional jumping motion and formulate a tightly coupled optimization problem accounting for the kinodynamic constraints, simultaneously optimizing CoM trajectory, Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs), and joint states. To meet the online requirements, we propose an accelerated evolutionary algorithm as the trajectory optimizer to address the complexity of kinodynamic constraints. To ensure stability and accuracy in environmental perception post-landing, we introduce a coarse-to-fine relocalization method that combines global Branch and Bound (BnB) search with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for precise positioning during navigation and jumping. The proposed framework achieves jump trajectory generation in approximately 0.1 seconds with a warm start and has been successfully validated on two quadruped robots on uneven terrains. Additionally, we extend the framework's versatility to humanoid robots.</p>
