<h2>Online optimisation for dynamic electrical impedance tomography</h2>
<h3>Neil Dizon, Jyrki Jauhiainen, Tuomo Valkonen</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.12944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online optimisation studies the convergence of optimisation methods as the data embedded in the problem changes. Based on this idea, we propose a primal dual online method for nonlinear time-discrete inverse problems. We analyse the method through regret theory and demonstrate its performance in real-time monitoring of moving bodies in a fluid with Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). To do so, we also prove the second-order differentiability of the Complete Electrode Model (CEM) solution operator on $L^\infty$.</p>

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for diagnosing cardiac pathologies, yet traditional paper-based ECG storage poses significant challenges for automated analysis. This study introduces ECGtizer, an open-source, fully automated tool designed to digitize paper ECGs and recover signals lost during storage. ECGtizer facilitates automated analyses using modern AI methods. It employs automated lead detection, three pixel-based signal extraction algorithms, and a deep learning-based signal reconstruction module. We evaluated ECGtizer on two datasets: a real-life cohort from the COVID-19 pandemic (JOCOVID) and a publicly available dataset (PTB-XL). Performance was compared with two existing methods: the fully automated ECGminer and the semi-automated PaperECG, which requires human intervention. ECGtizer's performance was assessed in terms of signal recovery and the fidelity of clinically relevant feature measurement. Additionally, we tested these tools on a third dataset (GENEREPOL) for downstream AI tasks. Results show that ECGtizer outperforms existing tools, with its ECGtizerFrag algorithm delivering superior signal recovery. While PaperECG demonstrated better outcomes than ECGminer, it required human input. ECGtizer enhances the usability of historical ECG data and supports advanced AI-based diagnostic methods, making it a valuable addition to the field of AI in ECG analysis.</p>

<h2>FootstepNet: an Efficient Actor-Critic Method for Fast On-line Bipedal Footstep Planning and Forecasting</h2>

<p>arXiv:2403.12589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing a humanoid locomotion controller is challenging and classically split up in sub-problems. Footstep planning is one of those, where the sequence of footsteps is defined. Even in simpler environments, finding a minimal sequence, or even a feasible sequence, yields a complex optimization problem. In the literature, this problem is usually addressed by search-based algorithms (e.g. variants of A*). However, such approaches are either computationally expensive or rely on hand-crafted tuning of several parameters. In this work, at first, we propose an efficient footstep planning method to navigate in local environments with obstacles, based on state-of-the art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques, with very low computational requirements for on-line inference. Our approach is heuristic-free and relies on a continuous set of actions to generate feasible footsteps. In contrast, other methods necessitate the selection of a relevant discrete set of actions. Second, we propose a forecasting method, allowing to quickly estimate the number of footsteps required to reach different candidates of local targets. This approach relies on inherent computations made by the actor-critic DRL architecture. We demonstrate the validity of our approach with simulation results, and by a deployment on a kid-size humanoid robot during the RoboCup 2023 competition.</p>

<h2>Towards joint graph learning and sampling set selection from data</h2>
<h3>Shashank N. Sridhara, Eduardo Pavez, Antonio Ortega</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.09753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the problem of sampling graph signals in scenarios where the graph structure is not predefined and must be inferred from data. In this scenario, existing approaches rely on a two-step process, where a graph is learned first, followed by sampling. More generally, graph learning and graph signal sampling have been studied as two independent problems in the literature. This work provides a foundational step towards jointly optimizing the graph structure and sampling set. Our main contribution, Vertex Importance Sampling (VIS), is to show that the sampling set can be effectively determined from the vertex importance (node weights) obtained from graph learning. We further propose Vertex Importance Sampling with Repulsion (VISR), a greedy algorithm where spatially -separated "important" nodes are selected to ensure better reconstruction. Empirical results on simulated data show that sampling using VIS and VISR leads to competitive reconstruction performance and lower complexity than the conventional two-step approach of graph learning followed by graph sampling.</p>
