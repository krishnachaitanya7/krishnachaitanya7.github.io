Abstract: In this article, we will first establish some density results for a locally $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$ and then identify a property, called Kaplansky density property (KDP). We then give a induced faithful continuous $*$-representation $\varphi$ of $\mathcal A^{**}$ (equipped with unique Arens product) on the space $B_{loc}(\mathcal H)$ such that $\varphi(\mathcal A^{**})\subset \overline{\pi(\mathcal A)}^{WOT}$, where $\pi:\mathcal A\to B_{loc}(\mathcal H)$ is the associated universal $*$-representation and $\mathcal H$ is the associated locally Hilbert space. Finally we show that for a Fr\'echet locally $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$ possessing KDP, the second strong dual is algebraically and topologically $*$-isomorphic to $ \overline{\pi(\mathcal A)}^{WOT}$, which is a direct analogue of the classical Sherman-Takeda theorem for $C^*$-algebras. We shall also observe the joint continuity of some associated bilinear maps in the running.</p>
