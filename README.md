<h2>A Carleman Semi-Discrete Convexification Method Combined With Deep Learning for Electrical Impedance Tomography</h2>
<h3>Michael V. Klibanov, Kirill V. Golubnichiy, Benjamin Jiang</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.18001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new semi-discrete version of the Carleman estimate-based convexification globally convergent numerical method is developed. It is used for the delivery of the starting point for the training procedure of deep learning. An important feature of the continuous version of the convexification method is that its convergence to the true solution is independent on the availability of a good first guess about this solution. A new concept of the h-strong convexity is introduced, where h is the grid step size in the semi-discrete version of the convexification method. The h -strong convexity allows to obtain an a priori accuracy estimate of the starting point for the training step of the deep learning procedure. This approach is demonstrated for a highly nonlinear problem of Electrical Impedance Tomography. Results of numerical experiments for complicated media structures demonstrate the computational feasibility of this procedure.</p>

<h2>Iterative McCormick Relaxation for Joint Impedance Control and Network Topology Optimization</h2>
<h3>Junseon Park, Hyeongon Park, Rahul K. Gupta</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.18059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system operators are increasingly deploying Variable Impedance Devices (VIDs), e.g., Smart Wires, and Network Topology Optimization (NTO) schemes for mitigating operational challenges such as line and transformer congestion, and voltage violations. This work aims to optimize and coordinate the operation of distributed VIDs considering fixed and optimized topologies. This problem is inherently non-linear due to power flow equations as well as bilinear terms introduced due to variable line impedance of VIDs. Furthermore, the topology optimization scheme makes it a mixed integer nonlinear problem. To tackle this, we introduce using McCormick relaxation scheme, which converts the bilinear constraints into a linear set of constraints along with the DC power flow equations. We propose an iterative correction of the McCormick relaxation to enhance its accuracy. The proposed framework is validated on standard IEEE benchmark test systems, and we present a performance comparison of the iterative McCormick method against the non-linear, SOS2 piecewise linear approximation, and original McCormick relaxation.</p>

<h2>Unifying approach to uniform expressivity of graph neural networks</h2>
<h3>Huan Luo, Jonni Virtema</h3>
<p>arXiv:2602.18409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is often analysed via correspondence to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm and fragments of first-order logic. Standard GNNs are limited to performing aggregation over immediate neighbourhoods or over global read-outs. To increase their expressivity, recent attempts have been made to incorporate substructural information (e.g. cycle counts and subgraph properties). In this paper, we formalize this architectural trend by introducing Template GNNs (T-GNNs), a generalized framework where node features are updated by aggregating over valid template embeddings from a specified set of graph templates. We propose a corresponding logic, Graded template modal logic (GML(T)), and generalized notions of template-based bisimulation and WL algorithm. We establish an equivalence between the expressive power of T-GNNs and GML(T), and provide a unifying approach for analysing GNN expressivity: we show how standard AC-GNNs and its recent variants can be interpreted as instantiations of T-GNNs.</p>

<h2>Physics-informed graph neural networks for flow field estimation in carotid arteries</h2>
<h3>Julian Suk, Dieuwertje Alblas, Barbara A. Hutten, Albert Wiegman, Christoph Brune, Pim van Ooij, Jelmer M. Wolterink</h3>
<p>arXiv:2408.07110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hemodynamic quantities are valuable biomedical risk factors for cardiovascular pathology such as atherosclerosis. Non-invasive, in-vivo measurement of these quantities can only be performed using a select number of modalities that are not widely available, such as 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this work, we create a surrogate model for hemodynamic flow field estimation, powered by machine learning. We train graph neural networks that include priors about the underlying symmetries and physics, limiting the amount of data required for training. This allows us to train the model using moderately-sized, in-vivo 4D flow MRI datasets, instead of large in-silico datasets obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as is the current standard. We create an efficient, equivariant neural network by combining the popular PointNet++ architecture with group-steerable layers. To incorporate the physics-informed priors, we derive an efficient discretisation scheme for the involved differential operators. We perform extensive experiments in carotid arteries and show that our model can accurately estimate low-noise hemodynamic flow fields in the carotid artery. Moreover, we show how the learned relation between geometry and hemodynamic quantities transfers to 3D vascular models obtained using a different imaging modality than the training data. This shows that physics-informed graph neural networks can be trained using 4D flow MRI data to estimate blood flow in unseen carotid artery geometries.</p>
