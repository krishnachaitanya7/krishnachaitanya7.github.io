<h2>A Nomizu-van Est theorem in Ekedahl's derived $\ell$-adic setting</h2>

<p>arXiv:2209.09744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theorem of Nomizu and van Est computes the cohomology of a compact nilmanifold, or equivalently the group cohomology of an arithmetic subgroup of a unipotent linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$. We prove a similar result for the cohomology of a compact open subgroup of a unipotent linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}$ with coefficients in a complex of continuous $\ell$-adic representations. We work with the triangulated categories defined by Ekedahl which play the role of ``derived categories of continuous $\ell$-adic representations''. This is motivated by Pink's formula computing the derived direct image of an $\ell$-adic local system on a Shimura variety in its minimal compactification, and its application to automorphic perverse sheaves on Shimura varieties. The key technical result is the computation of the cohomology with coefficients in a unipotent representation with torsion coefficients by an explicit complex of polynomial cochains which is of finite type.</p>

<h2>TEAS: Trusted Educational AI Standard: A Framework for Verifiable, Stable, Auditable, and Pedagogically Sound Learning Systems</h2>
<h3>Abu Syed</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid integration of AI into education has prioritized capability over trustworthiness, creating significant risks. Real-world deployments reveal that even advanced models are insufficient without extensive architectural scaffolding to ensure reliability. Current evaluation frameworks are fragmented: institutional policies lack technical verification, pedagogical guidelines assume AI reliability, and technical metrics are context-agnostic. This leaves institutions without a unified standard for deployment readiness. This paper introduces TEAS (Trusted Educational AI Standard), an integrated framework built on four interdependent pillars: (1) Verifiability, grounding content in authoritative sources; (2) Stability, ensuring deterministic core knowledge; (3) Auditability, enabling independent institutional validation; and (4) Pedagogical Soundness, enforcing principles of active learning. We argue that trustworthiness stems primarily from systematic architecture, not raw model capability. This insight implies that affordable, open-source models can achieve deployment-grade trust, offering a scalable and equitable path to integrating AI safely into learning environments globally.</p>
