Abstract: The paper at hand presents an in-depth investigation into the fatigue behavior of the high-strength aluminum alloy EN AW-7020 T6 using both experimental and numerical approaches. Two types of specimens are investigated: a dog-bone specimen subjected to cyclic loading in a symmetric strain-controlled regime, and a compact tension specimen subjected to repeated loading and unloading, which leads to damage growth from the notch tip. Experimental data from these tests are used to identify the different phases of fatigue. Subsequently, a plastic-damage model is developed, incorporating J2 plasticity with Chaboche-type mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening. A detailed investigation reveals that the Chaboche model must be blended with a suitable isotropic hardening and combined with a proper damage growth model to accurately describe cyclic fatigue including large plastic strains up to failure. Multiple back-stress components with independent properties are superimposed, and exponential isotropic hardening with saturation effects is introduced to improve alignment with experimental results. For damage, different stress splits are tested, with the deviatoric/volumetric split proving successful in reproducing the desired degradation in peak stress and stiffness. A nonlinear activation function is introduced to ensure smooth transitions between tension and compression. Two damage indices, one for the deviatoric part and one for the volumetric part, are defined, each of which is governed by a distinct trilinear damage growth function. The governing differential equation of the problem is regularized by higher-order gradient terms to address the ill-posedness induced by softening. Finally, the plasticity model is calibrated using finite element simulations of the dog-bone test and subsequently applied to the cyclic loading of the compact tension specimen.</p>

<h2>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of a trait-structured predator-prey model</h2>

<p>arXiv:2501.07379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between evolutionary and ecological changes (eco-evolutionary dynamics) has been shown to be relevant among diverse species, and is also of interest outside of ecology, i.e. in cancer evolution. These dynamics play an important role in determining survival in response to climate change, motivating the need for mathematical models to capture this often complex interplay. Population genetics models incorporating eco-evolutionary dynamics often sacrifice analytical tractability to model the complexity of real systems, and do not explicitly consider the effect of population heterogeneity. In order to allow for population heterogeneity, transient, and long-term dynamics, while retaining tractability, we generalise a moment-based method applicable in the regime of small segregational variance to the case of time-dependent mortality and birth. These results are applied to a predator-prey model, where ecological parameters such as the contact rate between species are trait-structured. The trait-distribution of the prey species is shown to be approximately Gaussian with constant variance centered on the mean trait, which is asymptotically governed by an autonomous ODE. In this way, we make explicit the impact of eco-evolutionary dynamics on the transient behaviour and long-term fate of the prey species.</p>

<h2>On the effect of the average clustering coefficient on topology-based link prediction in featureless graphs</h2>
<h3>Mehrdad Rafiepour, S. Mehdi Vahidipour</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.06721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental problem in graph theory with diverse applications, including recommender systems, community detection, and identifying spurious connections. While feature-based methods achieve high accuracy, their reliance on node attributes limits their applicability in featureless graphs. For such graphs, structure-based approaches, including common neighbor-based and degree-dependent methods, are commonly employed. However, the effectiveness of these methods depends on graph density, with common neighbor-based algorithms performing well in dense graphs and degree-dependent methods being more suitable for sparse or tree-like graphs. Despite this, the literature lacks a clear criterion to distinguish between dense and sparse graphs. This paper introduces the average clustering coefficient as a criterion for assessing graph density to assist with the choice of link prediction algorithms. To address the scarcity of datasets for empirical analysis, we propose a novel graph generation method based on the Barabasi-Albert model, which enables controlled variation of graph density while preserving structural heterogeneity. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we establish an empirical boundary for the average clustering coefficient that facilitates the selection of effective link prediction techniques.</p>

<h2>QuadWBG: Generalizable Quadrupedal Whole-Body Grasping</h2>

<p>arXiv:2411.06782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legged robots with advanced manipulation capabilities have the potential to significantly improve household duties and urban maintenance. Despite considerable progress in developing robust locomotion and precise manipulation methods, seamlessly integrating these into cohesive whole-body control for real-world applications remains challenging. In this paper, we present a modular framework for robust and generalizable whole-body loco-manipulation controller based on a single arm-mounted camera. By using reinforcement learning (RL), we enable a robust low-level policy for command execution over 5 dimensions (5D) and a grasp-aware high-level policy guided by a novel metric, Generalized Oriented Reachability Map (GORM). The proposed system achieves state-of-the-art one-time grasping accuracy of 89% in the real world, including challenging tasks such as grasping transparent objects. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our system can effectively manage a large workspace, from floor level to above body height, and perform diverse whole-body loco-manipulation tasks.</p>
