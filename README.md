<h2>Bifurcation Analysis of a Predator-Prey Model with Allee Effect and Cooperative Hunting</h2>
<h3>Yujie Gao, Ton Viet Ta</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel predator-prey model that integrate two ecologically significant mechanisms: the Allee effect in the prey population and cooperative hunting behavior among predators. Building upon the Rosenzweig-MacArthur framework, our model modifies the prey growth term to incorporate the Allee effect and introduces a nonlinear functional response reflecting predator cooperation.
  We establish the existence and boundedness of global solutions for the system and analyze the local and global stability of its equilibria. In addition, we perform a comprehensive bifurcation analysis, including transcritical, saddle-node, Hopf, and heteroclinic bifurcations, to explore how system dynamics change with key parameters. These results reveal rich and biologically relevant behaviors, such as multiple equilibria, transitions in stability, and the emergence of complex dynamical patterns.</p>

Abstract: The simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer of large-scale hydraulic robots presents a significant challenge in robotics because of the inherent slow control response and complex fluid dynamics. The complex dynamics result from the multiple interconnected cylinder structure and the difference in fluid rates of the cylinders. These characteristics complicate detailed simulation for all joints, making it unsuitable for reinforcement learning (RL) applications. In this work, we propose an analytical actuator model driven by hydraulic dynamics to represent the complicated actuators. The model predicts joint torques for all 12 actuators in under 1 microsecond, allowing rapid processing in RL environments. We compare our model with neural network-based actuator models and demonstrate the advantages of our model in data-limited scenarios. The locomotion policy trained in RL with our model is deployed on a hydraulic quadruped robot, which is over 300 kg. This work is the first demonstration of a successful transfer of stable and robust command-tracking locomotion with RL on a heavy hydraulic quadruped robot, demonstrating advanced sim-to-real transferability.</p>
