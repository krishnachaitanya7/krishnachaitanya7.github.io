<h2>Global Continuation of Stable Periodic Orbits in Systems of Competing Predators</h2>

<p>arXiv:2504.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a continuation technique to obtain global families of stable periodic orbits, delimited by transcritical bifurcations at both ends. To this end, we formulate a zero-finding problem whose zeros correspond to families of periodic orbits. We then define a Newton-like fixed-point operator and establish its contraction near a numerically computed approximation of the family. To verify the contraction, we derive sufficient conditions expressed as inequalities on the norms of the fixed-point operator, and involving the numerical approximation. These inequalities are then rigorously checked by the computer via interval arithmetic. To show the efficacy of our approach, we prove the existence of global families in an ecosystem with Holling's type II functional response, and thereby solve a stable connection problem proposed by Butler and Waltler in 1981. Our method does not rely on restricting the choice of parameters and is applicable to many other systems that numerically exhibit global families.</p>

<p>arXiv:2503.00967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI chatbots have emerged as promising educational tools for personalized learning experiences, with advances in large language models (LLMs) enabling teachers to create and customize these chatbots for their specific classroom needs. However, there is a limited understanding of how teachers create pedagogical chatbots and integrate them into their lessons. Through semi-structured interviews with seven K-12 teachers, we examined their practices and challenges when designing, implementing, and deploying chatbots. Our findings revealed that teachers prioritize developing task-specific chatbots aligned with their lessons. Teachers engaged in various creation practices and had different challenges; novices in chatbot creation struggled mainly with initial design and technical implementation, while experienced teachers faced challenges with technical aspects and analyzing conversational data. Based on these insights, we explore approaches to supporting teachers' chatbot development and opportunities for designing future chatbot creation systems. This work provides foundational insights from teachers that can empower teacher-created chatbots, facilitating AI-augmented teaching.</p>

<h2>Modified Tests of Linear Hypotheses Under Heteroscedasticity for Multivariate Functional Data with Finite Sample Sizes</h2>
<h3>Tianming Zhu</h3>
<p>arXiv:2504.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As big data continues to grow, statistical inference for multivariate functional data (MFD) has become crucial. Although recent advancements have been made in testing the equality of mean functions, research on testing linear hypotheses for mean functions remains limited. Current methods primarily consist of permutation-based tests or asymptotic tests. However, permutation-based tests are known to be time-consuming, while asymptotic tests typically require larger sample sizes to maintain an accurate Type I error rate. This paper introduces three finite-sample tests that modify traditional MANOVA methods to tackle the general linear hypothesis testing problem for MFD. The test statistics rely on two symmetric, nonnegative-definite matrices, approximated by Wishart distributions, with degrees of freedom estimated via a U-statistics-based method. The proposed tests are affine-invariant, computationally more efficient than permutation-based tests, and better at controlling significance levels in small samples compared to asymptotic tests. A real-data example further showcases their practical utility.</p>
