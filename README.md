<h2>On the effects of protection zone and directed population flux in prey-predator dynamics</h2>
<h3>Kousuke Kuto, Kazuhiro Oeda</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.05054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a spatial predator-prey model in which prey can enter a protection zone (refuge) inaccessible to predators, while predators exhibit directed movement toward prey-rich regions. The directed movement is modeled by a far-sighted population flux motivated by classical movement rules, in contrast to the more commonly analyzed near-sighted chemotaxis-type mechanisms. We first establish local-in-time well-posedness for the corresponding nonstationary problem under Neumann boundary conditions, despite the discontinuity induced by the refuge interface. We then investigate the stationary problem, focusing on how the coexistence states emerge and organize globally in parameter space. In particular, we identify the bifurcation threshold for positive steady states from semitrivial predator-only equilibria, and describe the global continuation of the resulting branches. Our analysis reveals that strong directed movement can induce turning-point structures and multiplicity of coexistence steady states, highlighting a nontrivial interplay between spatial protection and predator movement behavior.</p>

<h2>CompliantVLA-adaptor: VLM-Guided Variable Impedance Action for Safe Contact-Rich Manipulation</h2>
<h3>Heng Zhang, Wei-Hsing Huang, Qiyi Tong, Gokhan Solak, Puze Liu, Sheng Liu, Jan Peters, Arash Ajoudani</h3>
<p>arXiv:2601.15541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a CompliantVLA-adaptor that augments the state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with vision-language model (VLM)-informed context-aware variable impedance control (VIC) to improve the safety and effectiveness of contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks. Existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, Pi0, OpenVLA-oft) typically output position, but lack force-aware adaptation, leading to unsafe or failed interactions in physical tasks involving contact, compliance, or uncertainty. In the proposed CompliantVLA-adaptor, a VLM interprets task context from images and natural language to adapt the stiffness and damping parameters of a VIC controller. These parameters are further regulated using real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the VLA baselines on a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware, with improved success rates and reduced force violations. The overall success rate across all tasks increases from 9.86\% to 17.29\%, presenting a promising path towards safe contact-rich manipulation using VLAs. We release our code, prompts, and force-torque-impedance-scenario context datasets at https://sites.google.com/view/compliantvla.</p>

<h2>Medal Matters: Probing LLMs' Failure Cases Through Olympic Rankings</h2>
<h3>Juhwan Choi, Seunguk Yu, JungMin Yun, YoungBin Kim</h3>
<p>arXiv:2409.06518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, yet their internal knowledge structures remain poorly understood. This study examines these structures through the lens of historical Olympic medal tallies, evaluating LLMs on two tasks: (1) retrieving medal counts for specific teams and (2) identifying rankings of each team. While state-of-the-art LLMs excel in recalling medal counts, they struggle with providing rankings, highlighting a key difference between their knowledge organization and human reasoning. These findings shed light on the limitations of LLMs' internal knowledge integration and suggest directions for improvement. To facilitate further research, we release our code, dataset, and model outputs.</p>
