<h2>One Filter to Deploy Them All: Robust Safety for Quadrupedal Navigation in Unknown Environments</h2>
<h3>Albert Lin, Shuang Peng, Somil Bansal</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As learning-based methods for legged robots rapidly grow in popularity, it is important that we can provide safety assurances efficiently across different controllers and environments. Existing works either rely on a priori knowledge of the environment and safety constraints to ensure system safety or provide assurances for a specific locomotion policy. To address these limitations, we propose an observation-conditioned reachability-based (OCR) safety-filter framework. Our key idea is to use an OCR value network (OCR-VN) that predicts the optimal control-theoretic safety value function for new failure regions and dynamic uncertainty during deployment time. Specifically, the OCR-VN facilitates rapid safety adaptation through two key components: a LiDAR-based input that allows the dynamic construction of safe regions in light of new obstacles and a disturbance estimation module that accounts for dynamics uncertainty in the wild. The predicted safety value function is used to construct an adaptive safety filter that overrides the nominal quadruped controller when necessary to maintain safety. Through simulation studies and hardware experiments on a Unitree Go1 quadruped, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can automatically safeguard a wide range of hierarchical quadruped controllers, adapts to novel environments, and is robust to unmodeled dynamics without a priori access to the controllers or environments - hence, "One Filter to Deploy Them All".

<h2>A Clinical Tuning Framework for Continuous Kinematic and Impedance Control of a Powered Knee-Ankle Prosthesis</h2>
<h3>Emma Reznick, T. Kevin Best, Robert Gregg</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.10154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Configuring a prosthetic leg is an integral part of the fitting process, but the personalization of a multi-modal powered knee-ankle prosthesis is often too complex to realize in a clinical environment. This paper develops both the technical means to individualize a hybrid kinematic-impedance controller for variable-incline walking and sit-stand transitions, and an intuitive Clinical Tuning Interface (CTI) that allows prosthetists to directly modify the controller behavior.
  Methods: Utilizing an established method for predicting kinematic gait individuality alongside a new parallel approach for kinetic individuality, we applied tuned characteristics exclusively from level-ground walking to personalize continuous-phase/task models of joint kinematics and impedance. To take advantage of this method, we developed a CTI that translates common clinical tuning parameters into model adjustments. We then conducted a case study involving an above-knee amputee participant where a prosthetist iteratively tuned the prosthesis in a simulated clinical session involving walking and sit-stand transitions.
  Results: The prosthetist fully tuned the multi-activity prosthesis controller in under 20 min. Each iteration of tuning (i.e., observation, parameter adjustment, and model reprocessing) took 2 min on average for walking and 1 min on average for sit-stand. The tuned behavior changes were appropriately manifested in the commanded prosthesis torques, both at the tuned tasks and across untuned tasks (inclines).
  Conclusion: The CTI leveraged able-bodied trends to efficiently personalize a wide array of walking tasks and sit-stand transitions. A case-study validated the CTI tuning method and demonstrated the efficiency necessary for powered knee-ankle prostheses to become clinically viable.</p>

<h2>Shape error prediction in 5-axis machining using graph neural networks</h2>
<h3>Julia Huuk, Abheek Dhingra, Eirini Ntoutsi, Bernd Denkena</h3>
<p>arXiv:2412.10341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative method for predicting shape errors in 5-axis machining using graph neural networks. The graph structure is defined with nodes representing workpiece surface points and edges denoting the neighboring relationships. The dataset encompasses data from a material removal simulation, process data, and post-machining quality information. Experimental results show that the presented approach can generalize the shape error prediction for the investigated workpiece geometry. Moreover, by modelling spatial and temporal connections within the workpiece, the approach handles a low number of labels compared to non-graphical methods such as Support Vector Machines.</p>
