Abstract: Recently, reduced order modeling methods have been applied to solving inverse boundary value problems arising in frequency domain scattering theory. A key step in projection-based reduced order model methods is the use of a sesquilinear form associated with the forward boundary value problem. However, in contrast to scattering problems posed in $\mathbb{R}^d$, boundary value formulations lose certain structural properties, most notably the classical Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation is no longer available. In this paper we derive a Lippmann-Schwinger type equation aimed at studying the solution of a Helmholtz boundary value problem with a variable refractive index and impedance boundary conditions. In particular, we start from the variational formulation of the boundary value problem and we obtain an equivalent operator equation which can be viewed as a bounded domain analogue of the classical Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We first establish analytical properties of our variational Lippmann-Schwinger type operator. Based on these results, we then show that the parameter-to-state map, which maps a refractive index to the corresponding wavefield, maps weakly convergent sequences to strongly convergent ones when restricted to refractive indices in Lebesgue spaces with exponent greater than 2. Finally, we use the derived weak to strong sequential continuity to show existence of minimizers for a reduced order model based optimization methods aimed at solving the inverse boundary value problem as well as for a conventional data misfit based waveform inversion method.</p>

Abstract: Dengue continues to pose a major global threat, infecting nearly 390 million people annually. Recognizing the pivotal role of vector competence (vc), recent research focuses on mosquito parameters to inform transmission modeling and vector control strategies.This study models interactions between Aedes vectors and dengue pathogens, highlighting vc as a key driver of within vector infection dynamics and endemic persistence. Using a predator prey framework, we show that endemic conditions emerge naturally from the biological interplay between the vectors strategies to pathogen pressure and we prove global stability of such conditions. Our results reveal that under tropical and subtropical environmental pressures, the innate immune system of vectors cannot offset high vc during endemic outbreaks, highlighting a fundamental biological trade off, vectors can evolve increased transmission potential but cannot enhance immune capacity. This constraint defines the limits of their evolutionary response to pathogen driven selection and drives instability in disease transmission dynamics.</p>
