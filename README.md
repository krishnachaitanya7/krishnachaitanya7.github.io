<h2>Turing-Turing Bifurcation Analysis and Normal Form in a Predator-Prey Model with Predator-Taxis and Prey Refuge</h2>
<h3>Yehu Lv</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.09360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a predator-prey reaction-diffusion model incorporating predator-taxis and a prey refuge mechanism, subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Our primary focus is the analysis of codimension-two Turing-Turing bifurcation and the calculation of its associated normal form for this model. Firstly, employing the maximum principle and Amann's theorem, we rigorously establish the local existence and uniqueness of classical solutions. Secondly, utilizing linear stability theory and bifurcation theory, we conduct a thorough analysis of the existence and stability properties of the positive constant steady state. Furthermore, we derive precise conditions under which the model undergoes a Turing-Turing bifurcation. Thirdly, by applying center manifold reduction and normal form theory, we rigorously derive the method for calculating the third-truncated normal form characterizing the dynamics near the Turing-Turing bifurcation point. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to validate the theoretical findings, confirming the correctness of the analytical results concerning the bifurcation conditions and the derived normal form.</p>

<p>arXiv:2506.09113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Notable breakthroughs in diffusion modeling have propelled rapid improvements in video generation, yet current foundational model still face critical challenges in simultaneously balancing prompt following, motion plausibility, and visual quality. In this report, we introduce Seedance 1.0, a high-performance and inference-efficient video foundation generation model that integrates several core technical improvements: (i) multi-source data curation augmented with precision and meaningful video captioning, enabling comprehensive learning across diverse scenarios; (ii) an efficient architecture design with proposed training paradigm, which allows for natively supporting multi-shot generation and jointly learning of both text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. (iii) carefully-optimized post-training approaches leveraging fine-grained supervised fine-tuning, and video-specific RLHF with multi-dimensional reward mechanisms for comprehensive performance improvements; (iv) excellent model acceleration achieving ~10x inference speedup through multi-stage distillation strategies and system-level optimizations. Seedance 1.0 can generate a 5-second video at 1080p resolution only with 41.4 seconds (NVIDIA-L20). Compared to state-of-the-art video generation models, Seedance 1.0 stands out with high-quality and fast video generation having superior spatiotemporal fluidity with structural stability, precise instruction adherence in complex multi-subject contexts, native multi-shot narrative coherence with consistent subject representation.</p>

<h2>Bipedal Balance Control with Whole-body Musculoskeletal Standing and Falling Simulations</h2>
<h3>Chengtian Ma, Yunyue Wei, Chenhui Zuo, Chen Zhang, Yanan Sui</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.09383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention, quantitative understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This work presents a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via a comprehensive whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal dynamics of balancing during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle injury on balancing behavior, and generated fall contact patterns that aligned with clinical data. Furthermore, our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance and reduced muscle effort under perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level insights into human balance dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally. It could provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals with balance impairments and support the advancement of humanoid robotic systems.</p>

<h2>Scoop-and-Toss: Dynamic Object Collection for Quadrupedal Systems</h2>
<h3>Minji Kang, Chanwoo Baek, Yoonsang Lee</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.09406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadruped robots have made significant advances in locomotion, extending their capabilities from controlled environments to real-world applications. Beyond movement, recent work has explored loco-manipulation using the legs to perform tasks such as pressing buttons or opening doors. While these efforts demonstrate the feasibility of leg-based manipulation, most have focused on relatively static tasks. In this work, we propose a framework that enables quadruped robots to collect objects without additional actuators by leveraging the agility of their legs. By attaching a simple scoop-like add-on to one leg, the robot can scoop objects and toss them into a collection tray mounted on its back. Our method employs a hierarchical policy structure comprising two expert policies-one for scooping and tossing, and one for approaching object positions-and a meta-policy that dynamically switches between them. The expert policies are trained separately, followed by meta-policy training for coordinated multi-object collection. This approach demonstrates how quadruped legs can be effectively utilized for dynamic object manipulation, expanding their role beyond locomotion.</p>

<h2>Fully Bayesian Sequential Design for Mean Response Surface Prediction of Heteroscedastic Stochastic Simulations</h2>
<h3>Yuying Huang, Samuel W. K. Wong</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.09722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully Bayesian sequential strategy for predicting the mean response surface of heteroscedastic stochastic simulation functions. Leveraging dual Gaussian processes as the surrogate model and a criterion based on empirical expected integrated mean-square prediction error, our approach sequentially selects informative design points while fully accounting for parameter uncertainty. Sequential importance sampling is employed to efficiently update the posterior distribution of the parameters. Our strategy is tailored for expensive simulation functions, where achieving robust predictive accuracy under a limited budget is critical. We illustrate its potential advantages compared to existing approaches through synthetic examples. We then implement the proposed strategy on a real motivating application in seismic design of wood-frame podium buildings.</p>
