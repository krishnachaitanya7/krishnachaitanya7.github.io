Abstract: Traditional one-step preview planning algorithms for bipedal locomotion struggle to generate viable gaits when walking across terrains with restricted footholds, such as stepping stones. To overcome such limitations, this paper introduces a novel multi-step preview foot placement planning algorithm based on the step-to-step discrete evolution of the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) of walking robots. Our proposed approach adaptively changes the step duration and the swing foot trajectory for optimal foot placement under constraints, thereby enhancing the long-term stability of the robot and significantly improving its ability to navigate environments with tight constraints on viable footholds. We demonstrate its effectiveness through various simulation scenarios with complex stepping-stone configurations and external perturbations. These tests underscore its improved performance for navigating foothold-restricted terrains, even with external disturbances.</p>

Abstract: This work introduces EduEVAL-DB, a dataset based on teacher roles designed to support the evaluation and training of automatic pedagogical evaluators and AI tutors for instructional explanations. The dataset comprises 854 explanations corresponding to 139 questions from a curated subset of the ScienceQA benchmark, spanning science, language, and social science across K-12 grade levels. For each question, one human-teacher explanation is provided and six are generated by LLM-simulated teacher roles. These roles are inspired by instructional styles and shortcomings observed in real educational practice and are instantiated via prompt engineering. We further propose a pedagogical risk rubric aligned with established educational standards, operationalizing five complementary risk dimensions: factual correctness, explanatory depth and completeness, focus and relevance, student-level appropriateness, and ideological bias. All explanations are annotated with binary risk labels through a semi-automatic process with expert teacher review. Finally, we present preliminary validation experiments to assess the suitability of EduEVAL-DB for evaluation. We benchmark a state-of-the-art education-oriented model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) against a lightweight local Llama 3.1 8B model and examine whether supervised fine-tuning on EduEVAL-DB supports pedagogical risk detection using models deployable on consumer hardware.</p>
