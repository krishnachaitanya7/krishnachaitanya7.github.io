<p>arXiv:2509.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a delayed predator-prey system with Holling type II functional response, focusing on the interplay between time delay and carrying capacity. Using local and global Hopf bifurcation theory, we establish the existence of sequences of bifurcations as the delay parameter varies, and prove that the connected components of global Hopf branches are nested under suitable conditions. A novel contribution is to show that the classical limit cycle of the non-delayed system belongs to a connected component of the global Hopf bifurcation in Fuller's space. Our analysis combines rigorous functional differential equation theory with continuation methods to characterize the structure and boundedness of bifurcation branches. We further demonstrate that delays can induce oscillatory coexistence at lower carrying capacities than in the corresponding ODE model, yielding counterintuitive biological insights. The results contribute to the broader theory of global bifurcations in delay differential equations while providing new perspectives on nonlinear population dynamics.</p>

Abstract: Contrastive learning is a widely adopted self-supervised pretraining strategy, yet its dependence on cohort composition remains underexplored. We present Contrasting by Patient Augmented Electrocardiograms (CAPE) foundation model and pretrain on four cohorts (n = 5,203,352), from diverse populations across three continents (North America, South America, Asia). We systematically assess how cohort demographics, health status, and population diversity influence the downstream performance for prediction tasks also including two additional cohorts from another continent (Europe). We find that downstream performance depends on the distributional properties of the pretraining cohort, including demographics and health status. Moreover, while pretraining with a multi-centre, demographically diverse cohort improves in-distribution accuracy, it reduces out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation of our contrastive approach by encoding cohort-specific artifacts. To address this, we propose the In-Distribution Batch (IDB) strategy, which preserves intra-cohort consistency during pretraining and enhances OOD robustness. This work provides important insights for developing clinically fair and generalisable foundation models.</p>

<h2>CTBC: Contact-Triggered Blind Climbing for Wheeled Bipedal Robots with Instruction Learning and Reinforcement Learning</h2>

<p>arXiv:2509.02986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, wheeled bipedal robots have gained increasing attention due to their advantages in mobility, such as high-speed locomotion on flat terrain. However, their performance on complex environments (e.g., staircases) remains inferior to that of traditional legged robots. To overcome this limitation, we propose a general contact-triggered blind climbing (CTBC) framework for wheeled bipedal robots. Upon detecting wheel-obstacle contact, the robot triggers a leg-lifting motion to overcome the obstacle. By leveraging a strongly-guided feedforward trajectory, our method enables the robot to rapidly acquire agile leg-lifting skills, significantly enhancing its capability to traverse unstructured terrains. The approach has been experimentally validated and successfully deployed on LimX Dynamics' wheeled bipedal robot, Tron1. Real-world tests demonstrate that Tron1 can reliably climb obstacles well beyond its wheel radius using only proprioceptive feedback.</p>
