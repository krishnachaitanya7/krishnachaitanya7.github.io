<h2>Estimating a regression function under possible heteroscedastic and heavy-tailed errors. Application to shape-restricted regression</h2>
<h3>Yannick Baraud, Guillaume Maillard</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.00852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a regression framework where the design points are deterministic and the errors possibly non-i.i.d. and heavy-tailed (with a moment of order $p$ in $[1,2]$). Given a class of candidate regression functions, we propose a surrogate for the classical least squares estimator (LSE). For this new estimator, we establish a nonasymptotic risk bound with respect to the absolute loss which takes the form of an oracle type inequality. This inequality shows that our estimator possesses natural adaptation properties with respect to some elements of the class. When this class consists of monotone functions or convex functions on an interval, these adaptation properties are similar to those established in the literature for the LSE. However, unlike the LSE, we prove that our estimator remains stable with respect to a possible heteroscedasticity of the errors and may even converge at a parametric rate (up to a logarithmic factor) when the LSE is not even consistent. We illustrate the performance of this new estimator over classes of regression functions that satisfy a shape constraint: piecewise monotone, piecewise convex/concave, among other examples. The paper also contains some approximation results by splines with degrees in $\{0,1\}$ and VC bounds for the dimensions of classes of level sets. These results may be of independent interest.</p>

<h2>Refining Yoneda Lemma under Finiteness Constrains and Applications</h2>
<h3>Antonio Ceres, Cristina Costoya, Antonio Viruel</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Yoneda Lemma asserts that the isomorphism type of an object $a$ in a category $C$ is determined by the natural type of the set-valued functor $Hom_C(a,-)$. Here we show that if finiteness hypothesis are assumed to hold in $C$, then the isomorphism type of an object $a$ in $C$ is determined by the integer-valued function $|Hom_C(a,-)|$ on objects in $C$. We present applications of this result to the isomorphism problem in Group, Graph, and Ring Theory.</p>

<h2>Negative Moment Bounds for Sample Autocovariance Matrices of Stationary Processes Driven by Conditional Heteroscedastic Errors and Their Applications</h2>
<h3>Hsueh-Han Huang, Shu-Hui Yu, Ching-Kang Ing</h3>
<p>arXiv:2301.07476v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a negative moment bound for the sample autocovariance matrix of a stationary process driven by conditional heteroscedastic errors. This moment bound enables us to asymptotically express the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) of the least squares predictor as the sum of three terms related to model complexity, model misspecification, and conditional heteroscedasticity. A direct application of this expression is the development of a model selection criterion that can asymptotically identify the best (in the sense of MSPE) subset AR model in the presence of misspecification and conditional heteroscedasticity. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to confirm our theoretical results.</p>

<h3>Nikolaos Sampanis</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative pedagogical framework employing tangible interactive games to enhance artificial intelligence (AI) knowledge and literacy among elementary education students. Recognizing the growing importance of AI competencies in the 21st century, this study addresses the critical need for age-appropriate, experiential learning tools that demystify core AI concepts for young learners. The proposed approach integrates physical role-playing activities that embody fundamental AI principles, including neural networks, decision-making, machine learning, and pattern recognition. Through carefully designed game mechanics, students actively engage in collaborative problem solving, fostering deeper conceptual understanding and critical thinking skills. The framework further supports educators by providing detailed guidance on implementation and pedagogical objectives, thus facilitating effective AI education in early childhood settings. Empirical insights and theoretical grounding demonstrate the potential of tangible interactive games to bridge the gap between abstract AI theories and practical comprehension, ultimately promoting AI literacy at foundational educational levels. The study contributes to the growing discourse on AI education by offering scalable and adaptable strategies that align with contemporary curricular demands and prepare young learners for a technologically driven future.</p>

<h2>ARIANNA: An Automatic Design Flow for Fabric Customization and eFPGA Redaction</h2>
<h3>Luca Collini, Jitendra Bhandari, Chiara Muscari Tomajoli, Abdul Khader Thalakkattu Moosa, Benjamin Tan, Xifan Tang, Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon, Ramesh Karri, Christian Pilato</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.00857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the modern global Integrated Circuit (IC) supply chain, protecting intellectual property (IP) is a complex challenge, and balancing IP loss risk and added cost for theft countermeasures is hard to achieve. Using embedded configurable logic allows designers to completely hide the functionality of selected design portions from parties that do not have access to the configuration string (bitstream). However, the design space of redacted solutions is huge, with trade-offs between the portions selected for redaction and the configuration of the configurable embedded logic. We propose ARIANNA, a complete flow that aids the designer in all the stages, from selecting the logic to be hidden to tailoring the bespoke fabrics for the configurable logic used to hide it. We present a security evaluation of the considered fabrics and introduce two heuristics for the novel bespoke fabric flow. We evaluate the heuristics against an exhaustive approach. We also evaluate the complete flow using a selection of benchmarks. Results show that using ARIANNA to customize the redaction fabrics yields up to 3.3x lower overheads and 4x higher eFPGA fabric utilization than a one-fits-all fabric as proposed in prior works.</p>

<h2>STATE-NAV: Stability-Aware Traversability Estimation for Bipedal Navigation on Rough Terrain</h2>
<h3>Ziwon Yoon, Lawrence Y. Zhu, Lu Gan, Ye Zhao</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.01046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipedal robots have advantages in maneuvering human-centered environments, but face greater failure risk compared to other stable mobile plarforms such as wheeled or quadrupedal robots. While learning-based traversability has been widely studied for these platforms, bipedal traversability has instead relied on manually designed rules with limited consideration of locomotion stability on rough terrain. In this work, we present the first learning-based traversability estimation and risk-sensitive navigation framework for bipedal robots operating in diverse, uneven environments.</p>

<h2>Standing Tall: Robust Fall Prediction for Bipedal Robots</h2>
<h3>Gokul Prabhakaran, Jessy W. Grizzle, M. Eva Mungai</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the fall prediction algorithm from Mungai et al.(2024) to a real-time/online setting, implemented in both hardware and simulation. This yields results comparable to the offline version, maintaining a zero false positive rate, sufficient lead time, and accurate lead time prediction. Additionally, it achieves a high recovery rate. The paper also evaluates the fall prediction algorithm against omnidirectional faults and introduces an improved algorithm capable of reliably predicting falls and lead times across a wider range of faults in full-sized robots. Compared to Mungai et al.(2024), the proposed algorithm performs significantly better across all metrics, such as false positive rate, lead time, accuracy, and response time, demonstrating the algorithm's efficacy for real-time fall prediction in bipedal robots.</p>

<h2>BD at BEA 2025 Shared Task: MPNet Ensembles for Pedagogical Mistake Identification and Localization in AI Tutor Responses</h2>
<h3>Shadman Rohan, Ishita Sur Apan, Muhtasim Ibteda Shochcho, Md Fahim, Mohammad Ashfaq Ur Rahman, AKM Mahbubur Rahman, Amin Ahsan Ali</h3>
<p>arXiv:2506.01817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Team BD's submission to the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors, under Track 1 (Mistake Identification) and Track 2 (Mistake Location). Both tracks involve three-class classification of tutor responses in educational dialogues - determining if a tutor correctly recognizes a student's mistake (Track 1) and whether the tutor pinpoints the mistake's location (Track 2). Our system is built on MPNet, a Transformer-based language model that combines BERT and XLNet's pre-training advantages. We fine-tuned MPNet on the task data using a class-weighted cross-entropy loss to handle class imbalance, and leveraged grouped cross-validation (10 folds) to maximize the use of limited data while avoiding dialogue overlap between training and validation. We then performed a hard-voting ensemble of the best models from each fold, which improves robustness and generalization by combining multiple classifiers. Our approach achieved strong results on both tracks, with exact-match macro-F1 scores of approximately 0.7110 for Mistake Identification and 0.5543 for Mistake Location on the official test set. We include comprehensive analysis of our system's performance, including confusion matrices and t-SNE visualizations to interpret classifier behavior, as well as a taxonomy of common errors with examples. We hope our ensemble-based approach and findings provide useful insights for designing reliable tutor response evaluation systems in educational dialogue settings.</p>

<h2>Fall Prediction for Bipedal Robots: The Standing Phase</h2>
<h3>M. Eva Mungai, Gokul Prabhakaran, Jessy W. Grizzle</h3>
<p>arXiv:2309.14546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to fall prediction for bipedal robots, specifically targeting the detection of potential falls while standing caused by abrupt, incipient, and intermittent faults. Leveraging a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), our method aims to maximize lead time for fall prediction while minimizing false positive rates. The proposed algorithm uniquely integrates the detection of various fault types and estimates the lead time for potential falls. Our contributions include the development of an algorithm capable of detecting abrupt, incipient, and intermittent faults in full-sized robots, its implementation using both simulation and hardware data for a humanoid robot, and a method for estimating lead time. Evaluation metrics, including false positive rate, lead time, and response time, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Particularly, our model achieves impressive lead times and response times across different fault scenarios with a false positive rate of 0. The findings of this study hold significant implications for enhancing the safety and reliability of bipedal robotic systems.</p>

<h2>CHEQ-ing the Box: Safe Variable Impedance Learning for Robotic Polishing</h2>
<h3>Emma Cramer, Lukas J\"aschke, Sebastian Trimpe</h3>
<p>arXiv:2501.07985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic systems are increasingly employed for industrial automation, with contact-rich tasks like polishing requiring dexterity and compliant behaviour. These tasks are difficult to model, making classical control challenging. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution by enabling the learning of models and control policies directly from data. However, its application to real-world problems is limited by data inefficiency and unsafe exploration. Adaptive hybrid RL methods blend classical control and RL adaptively, combining the strengths of both: structure from control and learning from RL. This has led to improvements in data efficiency and exploration safety. However, their potential for hardware applications remains underexplored, with no evaluations on physical systems to date. Such evaluations are critical to fully assess the practicality and effectiveness of these methods in real-world settings. This work presents an experimental demonstration of the hybrid RL algorithm CHEQ for robotic polishing with variable impedance, a task requiring precise force and velocity tracking. In simulation, we show that variable impedance enhances polishing performance. We compare standalone RL with adaptive hybrid RL, demonstrating that CHEQ achieves effective learning while adhering to safety constraints. On hardware, CHEQ achieves effective polishing behaviour, requiring only eight hours of training and incurring just five failures. These results highlight the potential of adaptive hybrid RL for real-world, contact-rich tasks trained directly on hardware.</p>

<h2>ALPCAHUS: Subspace Clustering for Heteroscedastic Data</h2>
<h3>Javier Salazar Cavazos, Jeffrey A Fessler, Laura Balzano</h3>
<p>arXiv:2505.18918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data dimensionality reduction. Various methods have been proposed to extend PCA to the union of subspace (UoS) setting for clustering data that come from multiple subspaces like K-Subspaces (KSS). However, some applications involve heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This paper develops a heteroscedastic-focused subspace clustering method, named ALPCAHUS, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace bases associated with the low-rank structure of the data. This clustering algorithm builds on K-Subspaces (KSS) principles by extending the recently proposed heteroscedastic PCA method, named LR-ALPCAH, for clusters with heteroscedastic noise in the UoS setting. Simulations and real-data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing clustering algorithms.
